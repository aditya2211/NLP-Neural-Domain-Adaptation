<en=1>The Supreme Court announced its ruling today in Hamdan v. Rumsfeld divided along idelogical lines with John Roberts abstaining due to his involvement at the D.C. Circuit level and Anthony Kennedy joining the liberals in a 5 - 3 decision that is 185 pages long .
<en=2>The actual vote is a little confusing .
<en=3>Stay with me now : John Paul STEVENS delivered the opinion of the Court with respect to Parts I through IV , VI through VI - D - iii , VI - D - v , and VII , in which KENNEDY , SOUTER , GINSBURG , and BREYER joined , and an opinion with respect to Parts V and VI - D - iv , in which SOUTER , GINSBURG , and BREYER joined .
<en=4>BREYER filed a concurring opinion , in which KENNEDY , SOUTER , and GINSBURG joined .
<en=5>KENNEDY filed an opinion concurring in part , in which SOUTER , GINSBURG , and BREYER joined as to Parts I and II .
<en=6>SCALIA filed a dissenting opinion , in which THOMAS and ALITO joined .
<en=7>THOMAS filed a dissenting opinion , in which SCALIA joined , and in which ALITO joined as to all but Parts I , II - C - 1 , and III - B - 2 .
<en=8>ALITO filed a dissenting opinion , in which SCALIA and THOMAS joined as to Parts I through III .
<en=9>It will take me a little while to read the whole thing , but I rarely agree with a John Paul Stevens opinion .
<en=10>I 'll post highlights from the opinion and dissents when I 'm finished .
