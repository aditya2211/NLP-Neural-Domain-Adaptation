<en=1>President Bush pinched a few nerves yesterday with his choice of words :
<en=2>WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) -
<en=3>U.S. Muslim groups criticized President Bush on Thursday for calling a foiled plot to blow up airplanes part of a " war with Islamic fascists , " saying the term could inflame anti-Muslim tensions .
<en=4>U.S. officials have said the plot , thwarted by Britain , to blow up several aircraft over the Atlantic bore many of the hallmarks of al Qaeda .
<en=5>" We believe this is an ill - advised term and we believe that it is counterproductive to associate Islam or Muslims with fascism , " said Nihad Awad , executive director of the Council on American - Islamic Relations advocacy group .
<en=6>Which is why he did n't say we 're at war with Islamic people .
<en=7>We 're at war with Islamic fascists .
<en=8>By using the word " Islamic " as an adjective Bush was purposely not associating Muslims with fascism , hence the qualifier .
