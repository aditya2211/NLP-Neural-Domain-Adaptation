<en=5>Afraid I do n't have time today to discuss these , but some stories need attention :
<en=6>From Wednesday 's Mirror the headline , " Have 200,000 AK47s Fallen Into the Hands of Iraq Terrorists ? "
<en=7>( also see this thread on the RI discussion board ) :
<en=8>Some 200,000 guns the US sent to Iraqi security forces may have been smuggled to terrorists , it was feared yesterday .
<en=9>The 99 - tonne cache of AK47s was to have been secretly flown out from a US base in Bosnia .
<en=10>But the four planeloads of arms have vanished .
<en=11>Orders for the deal to go ahead were given by the US Department of Defense .
<en=12>But the work was contracted out via a complex web of private arms traders .
<en=13>And the Moldovan airline used to transport the shipment was blasted by the UN in 2003 for smuggling arms to Liberia , human rights group Amnesty has discovered .
<en=14>It follows a separate probe claiming that thousands of guns meant for Iraq 's police and army instead went to al - Qaeda .
<en=15>Amnesty chief spokesman Mike Blakemore said : " It 's unbelievable that no one can account for 200,000 assault rifles .
<en=16>If these weapons have gone missing it 's a terrifying prospect . "
<en=17>American defence chiefs hired a US firm to take the guns , from the 90s Bosnian war , to Iraq .
<en=18>But air traffic controllers in Baghdad have no record of the flights , which supposedly took off between July 2004 and July 2005 .
<en=19>A coalition forces spokesman confirmed they had not received " any weapons from Bosnia " and added they were " not aware of any purchases for Iraq from Bosnia " .
<en=20>Nato and US officials have already voiced fears that Bosnian arms - sold by US , British and Swiss firms - are being passed to insurgents .
<en=21>A NATO spokesman said : " There 's no tracking mechanism to ensure they do n't fall into the wrong hands .
<en=22>There are concerns that some may have been siphoned off . "
<en=23>This year a newspaper claimed two UK firms were involved in a deal in which thousands of guns for Iraqi forces were re-routed to al - Qaeda .
<en=24>The Moldovan airline is Aerocom , and yes , it 's one of Victor Bout 's .
<en=25>It 's always a bang - your - head - against - the - wall moment , reading again the play the incompetence theory receives , even from some of the Administration 's harshest mainstream critics .
<en=26>But then , even to talk of an " administration " may be misdirection at this point , given how little representative government means in the United States these days , and how much of " national security " has been privatized into a global gangland of drugs and guns .
<en=27>Like the tens of billions of dollars that have been " lost " in Iraq , planeloads of arms do n't just " vanish " ; not when the Pentagon contracts the work to an international criminal of Bout 's untouchable stature .
<en=28>But Bout 's name is n't likely to be mentioned in whatever coverage this story receives , before it sinks like so many others beneath the media 's frothing triviality .
<en=29>Meanwhile , a decision 's been reached in the trial of Toledo priest Gerald Robinson .
<en=30>And it 's guilty :
<en=31>The Rev. Gerald Robinson appeared stony - faced as the jury 's guilty verdict was read , and he blinked repeatedly and glanced at his lawyers before being led away in handcuffs .
<en=32>...
<en=33>The crime occurred in the sacristy adjoining the hospital chapel in downtown Toledo on the Saturday before Easter in 1980 .
<en=34>Investigators said the nun , Margaret Ann Pahl , 71 , was strangled and then stabbed , with nine wounds on her chest forming the shape of an inverted cross , a well - recognized Satanic symbol .
<en=35>An altar cloth was draped over her half - naked body , which was posed as if she had been sexually assaulted .
<en=36>" It was about how he could humiliate her the most , " prosecutor Dean Mandros said in closing arguments .
<en=37>" He left a message for everyone to see ... maybe to God himself . "
<en=38>After the sentencing one of Robinson 's tearful supporters " turned to Claudia Vercellotti , a local leader of the Survivors Network for Those Abused by Priests [ SNAP ] , who had helped reopen the case , and told her , ' I hope you rot in hell ! ' "
<en=39>From SNAP 's statement on the Robinson conviction :
<en=40>More than ever , police and prosecutors have the tools and the will to go after horrific crimes , even when the defendants are seemingly powerful individuals or institutions .
<en=41>When victims and witnesses stay silent , nothing changes .
<en=42>When victims and witnesses speak up , at least sometimes a child is protected , the truth is exposed , and justice is done .
<en=43>The murder weapon , Robinson 's letter opener :
<en=44>Finally , from an email , a follow - up on the reopening of the investigation into the Atlanta Child Murders :
<en=45>Dekalb County Police Chief Louis Graham ... the man who reopened the investigations last year , is mysteriously stepping down .
<en=46>And of all the people who the county is getting to find a replacement ... is none other than Lee Brown , the original supervisor of the Atlanta PD , who was in office during the murders and the subsequent investigation .
<en=47>SNAP is right in part .
<en=48>Police and prosecutors have the tools .
<en=49>The will is another matter .
<en=50>Some do , individually .
<en=51>But institutionally ?
<en=52>That 's still the domain of those who do n't .
<en=53>lots of important stories out there today jeff .... thank god and a few good souls for that conviction .
<en=54>Have you sent this to congress yet ?
<en=55>talk about law enforcement not having the will ...
<en=56>CRACKDOWN ON POLYGAMY GROUP
<en=57>Small polygamous groups have existed in the southwestern US under the watchful yet fairly benign eye of authorities ever since a sect known as the Fundamentalist Latter Day Saints ( FLDS ) separated itself from mainstream Mormonism in 1890 .
<en=58>...
<en=59>Now , FLDS leader Warren Jeffs has been added to the FBI 's list of " Ten Most Wanted Fugitives , " a move that caps law enforcement 's dramatic change of approach toward the polygamous group in recent years ... [ because of ] the impact that the group 's practices , law enforcement officials say , are having on the most vulnerable within the sect , particularly children and women .
<en=60>When the FLDS under Mr. Jeffs ( and his father before him ) grew to some 10,000 followers in several southwestern communities with estimated assets of $ 110 million ; when it became clear that government officials , school authorities , and police in those communities had become intertwined with the sect ; when ex-members increasingly reported child and sexual abuse charges ( mainly involving underage girls forced to marry older men ) ; and when the sect began to use secluded compounds , state and federal authorities started to crack down more vigorously .
<en=61>...
<en=62>Specifically , Jeffs is charged in Utah and Arizona with sexual assault of underage girls and with arranging " spiritual " marriages for girls and older men .
<en=63>At weekend press conferences in Salt Lake City and Phoenix , FBI and state officials said Jeffs " is considered armed and dangerous and may be traveling with armed bodyguards . "
<en=64>In the past , he has talked in apocalyptic terms about a violent end to the world , according to former members .
<en=65>...
<en=66>As with Christian Identity and other hate - related philosophies tied to the Aryan Nations and the neo-Nazi Creativity Movement , Jeffs has preached racism as well .
<en=67>" The black race is the people through which the devil has always been able to bring evil unto the earth , " Jeffs has said as cited by the Southern Poverty Law Center 's " Intelligence Report . "
<en=68>An editorial in the church - owned Deseret Morning News in Salt Lake City earlier this year acknowledged that " the state 's history , a conservative belief in free choice , and an unwillingness to stir up a hornet 's nest in the national media have likely all contributed to the kid - glove approach lawmakers and law - enforcement officers have taken when dealing with polygamous communities . "

<en=70>Maybe I 'm missing something here , but how , exactly , does one ' Loose ' 200,000 AK47's ?
<en=71>" There 's no tracking mechanism in place " ?!?!?
<en=72>Never mind .
<en=73>No need to worry .
<en=74>I 'm sure this kind of thing goes on all the time .
<en=75>We now return you to your regularly scheduled programming ....
<en=76>just go here , it s simply amazing
<en=77>The Raw Story
<en=78>i count like 14 explosive headlines .
<en=79>Then , of course , there is the evidence the jury did not hear about in the Robinson case ...
<en=80>Funny how some things are squirelled away by well - meaning prosecutors ...
<en=81>Maybe because they hint at a larger conspiracy / network of abusers / satanic underground ?
<en=82>I read of a case not long ago when some people were trying to get a polygamous judge taken off the bench for not obeying state law .
<en=83>Of course law enforcement has dragged it's feet when members are taking part in the activity themselves .
<en=84>Personally I do n't give a damn what adults do to one another as long as there is no abuse invovled .
<en=85>It is the marrying off of young girls to older men often close relatives that enfurates me .
<en=86>Also these cults have multimillions yet the women and kids live in poverty so the leaders can live the high life .
<en=87>In the Warren Jeffs cult he reassigns wives if the husband displeases him or to reward the new husband .
<en=88>Husbands marry mothers and teen daughters at the same time .
<en=89>a rare form of retardation is showing up in that group more than anywhere else in the world .
<en=90>It is genetic and the child needs to get the gene from both parents to turn into a vegetable instead of a thinking child .
<en=91>The doctor begs them to stop intermarrying but they say they have to keep the blood pure .
<en=92>look up fumarase deficiency for more info .
<en=93>Also look up the kingston family .
<en=94>One member actually was convicted of beating his teen daughter unconcious when she ran away from ' marriage ' to her father 's own brother .
<en=95>no one was charged for forced marriage , only the beating .
<en=96>So we " lost " some weapon ?
<en=97>It 's a good thing too .
<en=98>We would n't want those terrorists to run out of shit to shoot at us .
<en=99>Then the war might stop & all those juicy profits would just evaporate .
<en=100>What 's a few dead soldiers in comparison to keeping all those defense contractors awash in all that tax cash ?
<en=101>They really are milking the incompetence angle though , are n't they ?
<en=102>Just another big Iraq whoopsie daisy , huh ?
<en=103>Christ , you 'd think America would get a bit tired of these guys treating her like she was populated with nothing but gullible idiots .
<en=104>I suppose that it 's damn lucky for the GOP that she is populated with gullible idiots .
<en=105>US outsourcing special ops , intelligence to Iraq terror group , intelligence officials say
<en=106>The Pentagon is bypassing official US intelligence channels and turning to a dangerous and unruly cast of characters in order to create strife in Iran in preparation for any possible attack , former and current intelligence officials say ...
<en=107>http://www.rawstory.com/news/2006/US_outsourcing_special_operations_intelligence_gathering_0413.html
<en=108>A country deserves the leaders it has , my friends ...
<en=109>And MEK -- the Iranian ( not Iraqi ) terror group in question -- is itself unquestionably a cult :
<en=110>As the leaders like to boast , the Mujahedeen is a family affair .
<en=111>( '' We have three generations of martyrs : grandmothers , mothers , daughters . '' )
<en=112>Most of the girls I was meeting had grown up in Mujahedeen schools in Ashraf , where they lived separated from their parents .
<en=113>Family visits were allowed on Thursday nights and Fridays .
<en=114>When Iraq invaded Kuwait , many of these girls were transported to Jordan and then smuggled to various countries -- Germany , France , Canada , Denmark , England , the United States -- where they were raised by guardians who were usually Mujahedeen supporters .
<en=115>When they were 18 or 19 , many of them decided to come back to Iraq and fill the ranks of the youngest Mujahedeen generation .
<en=116>Though '' decided '' is probably not the right word , since from the day they were born , these girls and boys were not taught to think for themselves but to blindly follow their leaders .
<en=117>'' Every morning and night , the kids , beginning as young as 1 and 2 , had to stand before a poster of Massoud and Maryam , salute them and shout praises to them , '' Nadereh Afshari , a former Mujahedeen deep - believer , told me .
<en=118>Afshari , who was posted in Germany and was responsible for receiving Mujahedeen children during the gulf war , said that when the German government tried to absorb Mujahedeen children into their education system , the Mujahedeen refused .
<en=119>Many of the children were sent to Mujahedeen schools , particularly in France .
<en=120>The Rajavis , Afshari went on to say , '' saw these kids as the next generation 's soldiers .
<en=121>They wanted to brainwash them and control them . ''
<en=122>Which may explain the pattern to their stories : a journey to self - empowerment and the enlightenment of self - sacrifice inspired by the light and wisdom of Maryam and Massoud .

<en=124>One has to wonder whether the bright fellows in our government and military who set up the deals with these people do n't know what they are , do n't care , or know perfectly well .

<en=145>So ... put some information in there .
<en=146>You know , nature hates a void . :)
<en=147>Richard ,
<en=148>i agree , Hmmmmmm .
<en=149>How are chants of death and suicide ... morality .
<en=150>What about Manson 's tees bearing the message , " Kill your parents " .
<en=151>And were the Columbine killers acting out this " real morality " when they indescriminately murdered their classmates .
<en=152>They were death metal brainwashed fans , literally fulfilling the death metal paradigm , er ... morality .
<en=153>( not church morality , no that is phoney , love thy neighbor ... hell no , kill thy neighbor - now that is REAL MORALITY ????? )
<en=154>So , hmmmm indeed .
<en=155>I detect the hissing lisp of the lying serpent in this article .
<en=156>The deathly inversion of truth , ala satanism .
<en=157>I think the jury 's still out on exactly who did the brainwashing when in regard to the Columbine killers .
<en=158>Perhaps we should look at the death metal phenomenon less as an invitation to violence than as a couter-cultural response to the over hypocrisy of a large percentage of the ' Church - Morality ' crowd , which gives a lot of lip service to loving thy neighbor , but does n't apply that love very far beyond their own congregation .
<en=159>The last I checked , the Satanists have a long way to go to catch up with the death and destruction dealt out by self - proclaimed ( though false ) Christians .

<en=163>Well , it 's not as simple and clear cut as all that .

<en=165>The Kevin Coogan publication posted on the previous thread might serve as a good launching point for further discussion .
<en=166>The following quote is from that Coogan article :

<en=171>I would n't wonder too hard .
<en=172>The answer is likely D : all of the above , due to this being a complex reality we live in .
<en=173>But to me , without question , they often know perfectly well .
<en=174>Here is a thought : When the appartently cognitively functional take actions that seem senseless and incompetent , it is a most certain sign that they have ulterior or hidden motives .

<en=178>& here I am thinking that I really must be getting old .
<en=179>Since the article was specifically about " death metal " I guess the author missed this little tidbit or we just have waaaaaaaaaaaaay different definitions of morality :
<en=180>http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/programmes/this_world/4446342.stm
<en=181>One man 's relentless search for his missing son led him to uncover one of the most shocking crimes in post-war Italy - a tale of satanism and violence that has gripped the country for more than a year .
<en=182>In January 1998 Fabio Tollis and Chiara Marino , both just 16 , disappeared .
<en=183>They had been drinking at a pub called the Midnight - the centre of the heavy metal scene in Milan - and they never came home .
<en=184>The police and many of their friends just thought they had run off together .
<en=185>But their parents refused to accept this .
<en=186>Michele Tollis , Fabio 's father , began to attend metal concerts and festivals across Europe , handing out leaflets and quizzing Fabio 's friends .
<en=187>Fabio and his friends were into the most extreme forms of heavy metal music - death metal and black metal , music obsessed with images of murder and satanism - and the role of this music is central to the story .
<en=188>No one can contradict me when I say that heavy metal and satanism are closely linked
<en=189>Michele Tollis
<en=190>It emerged that Chiara , the girl who disappeared with Fabio , had a collection of satanic literature and paraphernalia in her bedroom .
<en=191>During this search , Michele Tollis became convinced that satanism had something to do with his son 's disappearance .
<en=192>" No one can contradict me when I say that heavy metal and satanism are closely linked .
<en=193>They 're inseparable , " he says .
<en=194>Yeah , I think Jeff wrote on one of his posts here in the past several months : " To hell with death " .
<en=195>I wholly agree , and would expand that statement to include : " To hell with death metal " .
<en=196>The freaky thing here is that these bozos are seriously claiming the moral high ground ? ? ? ? ?
<en=197>Talk about a beat - your - head - against - the - wall moment !
<en=198>And for ' Smartwolf ' above , think about the inversion principle being employed .
<en=199>They are doing it deliberately .
<en=200>Do you really think GWB , and neocons in general are representative of true followers of Jesus of Nazareth ?
<en=201>( I know , ignorant question ) Then why call them , or any other phonies ' Christians ' , even if they themselves claim the appellation .
<en=202>They are merely imposters .
<en=203>Everything they claim is a lie , and this above all .
<en=204>So why even credit their claims ?
<en=205>This only serves their purposes .
<en=206>They want to be identified as ' Christians ' , and I fully suspect that for some of them , the motivation behind their subterfuge is more than mere political advantage , and has a lot more to do with the black magician 's practice of the inversion principle .
<en=207>We need to be more ' rigorous ' about how we perceive these people .
<en=208>See them as they are , not for what they claim to be .
<en=209>... the most extreme forms of heavy metal music - death metal and black metal , music obsessed with images of murder and satanism - and the role of this music is central to the story .
<en=210>Almost all of the avant guard art movements of the early 20th Century ( except for Italian Futurism ) were labeled ' degenerate ' by the National Socialists .
<en=211>Adolf Hitler even held an exhibition of ' degenerate art ' in 1937 , while curating a parallel show of ' Aryan ' art across the street .
<en=212>The German Expressionist movement was destroyed as a result .
<en=213>Here 's a quick overview of the Entartete Kunst ( Degenerate Art ) exhibit of 1937 :
<en=214>http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Degenerate_art
<en=215>Ironically ( or perhaps not ) , the notion of the ' degenerate ' and ' degenerate art ' was appropriated by the Nazis and its origins can be traced back to Jewish ' intellectual ' Max Nordau and a 1892 book he authored called Degeneration . .
<en=216>Nordau was also the co founder of the World Zionist Organization .
<en=217>When the apparently cognitively functional take actions that seem senseless and incompetent , it is a most certain sign that they have ulterior or hidden motives .
<en=218>They trust you and me to be befuddled by their actions , while they " do as they wilt . "
<en=219>A question :
<en=220>Are the adherent of ' Crowleyan Thelema ' and others of similar ilk appropriating or appropriating from the appropriators to redirect ' energy ? '
<en=221>Does this reappropriation lead to or originate from the same place ?
<en=222>Seems as if there is a clear distinction being made between the ' imaginary ' Whore of Babalon and the actually Whore of Babylon , which is this global system .
<en=223>Is the distinction accurate and valid ?
<en=224>Does the distinction actually exist ?
<en=225>This is where the socio - political aspect of this conundrum comes into play .
<en=226>Confused ?
<en=227>Good .
<en=228>so , enemy , what 's your point ?
<en=229>Why do n't you state it ?
<en=230>My point is that these are all just questions and I am undecided as to the answers .
<en=231>Here 's another interesting example :

<en=270>In scanning the whitehouse.gov site today , I noticed the following Executive Order :
<en=271>Executive Order : Amendments to Executive Orders 11030 , 13279 , 13339 , 13381 , and 13389 , and *** Revocation *** of Executive Order 13011 ....

<en=275>Tronicus :
<en=276>Simply , the questions permeate the entire ' Western ( Mystery ) Tradition ' and perhaps ' Eastern ' as well , as they relate to the confluence of politics and spirituality .
<en=277>For example , is the system of Crowleyan Thelema a failed alchemical process ?
<en=278>Or was it supposed to initially be a process of alchemical appropriation ?
<en=279>Similarly , is invoking ancient Egyptian gods and goddesses a reaffirmation of an oppressive and hierarchical system ?
<en=280>In my opinion , people can no longer afford to partition out and compartmentalize personal spiritual and political systems .
<en=281>The ' high weirdness ' and more hardcore political ' factions ' must perhaps integrate and arrive at a synthesis .
<en=282>In regards to death metal , the problem is , once again , a question of education , history and the vacuous lack of perspective in American culture .

<en=284>Baudelaire was perhaps one of the first ' death metal ' artists .
<en=285>Tronicus , if you 're still checking this thread :
<en=286>A bit of a knee - jerk reaction from me there , and I apologize for my over-generalizations .
<en=287>My real problem is with literalist fundamentalists , of any religion .
<en=288>True believers are dangerous animals .
<en=289>I just get hung up on ' Christians ' , as they 're the dominant form where I come from .
<en=290>Also , I 'm quite clear on the fact that those in power now ( and , in general , most anyone at the top of a pyrimidal power structure ) tend to use the dominant religion as a cloak to hide their true motivations and as a tool to control the masses .
<en=291>It boggles the mind that ANYONE can take at face value Bush 's claims to be a christian , yet many seem to do just that .
<en=292>I seem to remember something about ' by their works shall ye know them . "
<en=293>I do get my hackles up a bit when people haul out the old ' Rock - N - Roll made them do it ' argument .
<en=294>Whie I do n't subscribe to the notion that the things we watch or listen to have no effect on our behavior ( which I think is patently rediculous ) , it does bother me when people single out a specific group of people to pin the blame on .
<en=295>Sub-cultures ( as the lable implies ) do not develope in a vacuum .
<en=296>Again , I think the problem is people who sink to far into their own egos , and begin to take their personal metaphors a bit too literaly .
<en=297>These people are dangerous wether they 're head - banging to ' Canibal Corpse ' or humming along to ' Onward Christian Soldiers ' .
<en=298>( The mixing of religion and militarism is a whole other topic .... )
<en=299>I have nothing but respect for people who adhear to non-violence , forgiveness , and charity , but it 's important to remember that Christians ( or ' Smartwolves ' ) do not have a monopoly on that particular lifestyle .
<en=300>Peace .
<en=301>The fact that the US government and media are having a hissy fit over Venezuela wanting to buy guns , and then 200,000 of the guns Chavez wants to buy go missing on their way to Iraq is definitely sus .
<en=302>I guess those guns will be located enroute to Venezuela or found in storage there by one of the US 's local stooges and they then have a pretext to ramp the spin up a notch or two .
