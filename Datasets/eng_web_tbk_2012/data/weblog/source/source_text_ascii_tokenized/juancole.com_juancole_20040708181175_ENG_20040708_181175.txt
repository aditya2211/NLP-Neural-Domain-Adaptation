<en=1>George W. Bush alleged Thursday that John Edwards lacks the experience necessary to be president .
<en=2>The problem with this argument is that Bush lacked the experience necessary to be president when he ran in 2000 , so this sort of cheap shot just hoists him by his own petard .
<en=3>Let 's just remember a seminal Bush moment in 1999 :
<en=4>' Bush fails reporter 's pop quiz on international leaders

<en=7>WASHINGTON ( CNN ) --
<en=8>Texas Gov. George W. Bush is enduring sharp criticism for being unable to name the leaders of four current world hot spots , but President Bill Clinton says Bush " should , and probably will , pick up " those names .
<en=9>The front - runner for the 2000 Republican presidential nomination faltered Thursday in an international affairs pop quiz posed by Andy Hiller , a political reporter for WHDH - TV in Boston .
<en=10>Bush
<en=11>Hiller asked Bush to name the leaders of Chechnya , Taiwan , India and Pakistan .
<en=12>Bush was only able to give a partial response to the query on the leader of Taiwan , referring to Taiwanese President Lee Teng - hui simply as " Lee . "
<en=13>He could not name the others .
<en=14>" Can you name the general who is in charge of Pakistan ? "
<en=15>Hiller asked , inquiring about Gen. Pervaiz Musharraf , who seized control of the country October 12 .
<en=16>" Wait , wait , is this 50 questions ? " asked Bush .
<en=17>Hiller replied : " No , it 's four questions of four leaders in four hot spots . " . . .
<en=18>Bush , in answering the question about the leader of Pakistan , also said : " The new Pakistani general , he 's just been elected -- not elected , this guy took over office .
<en=19>It appears this guy is going to bring stability to the country and I think that 's good news for the subcontinent . "
<en=20>Gore released a statement Friday taking Bush to task for his comments on Pakistan 's recent coup .
<en=21>" I find it troubling that a candidate for president in our country -- the world 's oldest democracy -- would characterize the military takeover as " good news , " Gore said .
<en=22>" Further , I find it even more disturbing that he made these comments about a nation that just last year tested nuclear weapons -- shortly after voicing his public opposition to the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty .
<en=23>A spokesman for President Clinton also criticized Bush 's comments .
<en=24>" It is very dangerous for this country to condone the overthrow of democratically elected governments , " said David Leavy , spokesman for the National Security Council .
<en=25>Not only did Bush not know who General Pervez Musharraf was , he seems to have confused coup - making with " taking office , " and moreover went on to suggest that the overthrow of an elected prime minister and the installation in power of the Pakistan military , then the world 's strongest supporter of the Taliban , would bring " stability ! "
<en=26>Musharraf made his coup in part because of the military 's anger over Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif 's willingness to back down from confronting India over Kashmir , so that he explicitly came to power as a warmonger .
<en=27>I ca n't tell you how ominous I found Bush 's performance in that interview .
<en=28>I still remember him stuttering about " the General , " unable to remember Musharraf 's name .
<en=29>He obviously had no idea what he was talking about , though he demonstrated a number of ill - fated instincts .
<en=30>He obviously liked authoritarian rule better than democracy , equating dictatorship with " stability . "
<en=31>And , he did n't think he needed to know anything about South Asia , with its nuclear giants and radical religious politics -- the latter a dire security threat to the US .
<en=32>He could n't tell when things were becoming more unstable as opposed to less .
<en=33>Musharraf went on to play nuclear brinkmanship with India in 2002 , risking war twice that year .
<en=34>Although Musharraf did turn against the Taliban after September 11 , under extreme duress from the US , elements of his military continued to support radical Islamism and have recently been implicated in assassination attempts on Musharraf himself .
<en=35>This was the body that Bush proclaimed was bringing " stability " to the region in fall of 1999 .
<en=36>So , one answer to Bush 's charge about Edwards is that if it had any merit , Bush should have declined to run himself .
<en=37>Another answer is that Edwards certainly knows far more about foreign affairs now than Bush did then .
<en=38>Indeed , given how Bush has rampaged around the world alienating allies and ignoring vital conflicts with the potential to blow back on the US , one might well argue that Edwards knows more now than Bush does .
<en=39>This is what Edwards ' campaign literature said about his positions : " Edwards believes that the U.S. must be an active leader to help resolve conflicts , from reducing tensions between India and Pakistan to the peace process in Northern Ireland .
<en=40>Edwards is a strong supporter of Israel , and believes that the U.S. has a vital role in promoting peace between the Israelis and the Palestinians . "
<en=41>I do n't see Bush doing any of this .
