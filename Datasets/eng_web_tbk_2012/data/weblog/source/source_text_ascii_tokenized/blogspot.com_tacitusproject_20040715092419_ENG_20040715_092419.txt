<en=1>Important news such as President Bush 's miniscule calibrations on his marriage amendment / anti-gay ( update : he 's not against gays in the bedroom , just at the altar , where of course their relationships should not only be frowned upon but should be constitutionally excluded ) has pushed Sudan not just off the front pages , or the A section , but out of the NY Times and Washington Post completely .
<en=2>I had to go to the BBC for this report .
<en=3>It 's symptomatic , I suppose , of our fast - paced , 24 hour news - cycle lives , that the biggest short - term humanitarian crisis in the world would quickly be eclipsed , once our Secretary of State was finished with his whirlwind tour , from the newspapers .
<en=4>It 's just disappointing .
<en=5>Most troubling , however , is the fact that the political will to end the crisis expressed a few short weeks ago seems to have ebbed .
<en=6>At that time , UN Secretary General Kofi Annan demanded steps be taken to end the ethnic violence in Darfur within 48 hours .
<en=7>Two weeks later , and the violence continues .
<en=8>The African Union is clearly not up to the task of keeping the peace , pledging 300 troops to an area that will need 15,000 , according to analysts .
<en=9>And international donors have given only half of the relief aid that Darfur needs , according to the local UN officials .
<en=10>So hear we are , two weeks later , after that dazzling PR display two weeks ago by Powell and Annan , and the situation on the ground in Darfur appears basically unchanged .
