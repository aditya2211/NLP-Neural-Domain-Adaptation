<en=1>Warren Buffett is giving away 85 % of his wealth , mostly to the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation .
<en=2>It 's a move that really worries me ; Buffett 's usual justification for keeping most of his money was that he was still compounding the value of his fortune at a pretty high rate , so any gifts now would mean significantly less money for the foundation later .
<en=3>It 's a little hard to parse , but at this point his ostensible view is that the Gateses are very good money - redistributors , and he wants them to have the money as soon as possible .
<en=4>Which essentially sounds like he 's worried that Bill or Melinda are going to die soon .
<en=5>I assume his actual reason is that he 's worried that Berkshire Hathaway just ca n't grow quickly enough to justify his usual charity policy .
<en=6>I 'm not sure how the market will react .
<en=7>It does n't change the company 's intrinsic worth , and as the article notes , the company might be added to a major index once the shares get more liquid .
<en=8>On the other hand , this is essentially a statement that the company is overpriced from the guy who knows it best -- and happens to be the best investor of the last century .
<en=9>em ... no ... the Gates foundation mainly invests in medical research and education , that means donating now adds a tremendous value compared to donating in ten years .
<en=10>Because the 10.000.000 people dying from malaria will otherwise be dead .
<en=11>i.e .
<en=12>He 's not giving 85 % away , he 's giving a number of shares each year that decrease in number at the rate of 5 % a year ( until gone ? ) .
<en=13>He mentions his wife 's death having an effect on him .
<en=14>It sounds pretty rational that he 's saying that Bill and Melinda are at a prime spot , so starting the money hose now is a good idea , but Buffet is still keeping most of his donation inside of Berkshire where it will compound .
