<en=1>Remember when a whole lot of people had to die because a Swedish newspaper printed those cartoons of the Prophet Mohammed ?
<en=2>Now Iran wants to turn the tables and is inviting cartoonists to do their best by depicting the Holocaust .
<en=3>Amazingly , these idiots think a cartoon of Mohammed is comparable to what we can expect in this new fun contest :
<en=4>TEHRAN ( AFP ) -
<en=5>An international contest of cartoons on the Holocaust opened in Tehran in response to the publication in Western papers last September of caricatures of the Prophet Mohammed .
<en=6>" We staged this fair to explore the limits of freedom Westerners believe in , " Masoud Shojai , head of the country 's " Iran Cartoon " association and the fair organizer , said .
<en=7>" They can freely write anything they like about our prophet , but if one raises doubts about the Holocaust he is either fined or sent to prison , " he added .
<en=8>" Though we do not deny that fact that Jews were killed in the ( second world ) war , why should the Palestinians pay for it ? "
<en=9>Shojai told the opening ceremony of the month - long fair in Tehran 's Palestine Contemporary Art Museum .
<en=10>He added that around 1,100 cartoons were submitted by participants from more than 60 countries and that more than 200 are on show .
<en=11>He said the top three cartoons will be announced on September 2 , with the winners being awarded prizes of 12,000 , 8,000 and 5,000 dollars respectively .
<en=12>This cute little stunt is only going to prove just how fanatic the extremist Muslims are .
<en=13>When they saw a cartoon of their prophet , people had to die .
<en=14>When their precious cartoons are released I highly doubt it will look like the end of the world .
