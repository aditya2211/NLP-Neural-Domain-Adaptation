<en=1>The Coalition decision to provoke a fight with Muqtada al - Sadr 's movement only three months before the Coalition Provisional Authority goes out of business has to be seen as a form of gross incompetence in governance .
<en=2>How did the CPA get to the point where it has turned even Iraqi Shiites , who were initially grateful for the removal of Saddam Hussein , against the United States ?
<en=3>Where it risks fighting dual Sunni Arab and Shiite insurgencies simultaneously , at a time when US troops are rotating on a massive scale and hoping to downsize their forces in country ?
<en=4>At a time when the Spanish , Thai and other contingents are already committed to leaving , and the UN is reluctant to get involved ?
<en=5>One answer is that the Pentagon prevented the State Department from running the CPA .
<en=6>State is the body with experience in international affairs and administration .
<en=7>The civilians in the Department of Defense only know how to blow things up .
<en=8>Rumsfeld , Wolfowitz and Feith staffed the CPA with Neoconservatives , most of whom had no administrative experience , no Arabic , and no respect for Muslim culture ( or knowledge about it ) .
<en=9>They actively excluded State Department Iraq hands like Tom Warrick .
<en=10>( Only recently have a few experienced State Department Arabists been allowed in to try to begin mopping up the mess . )
<en=11>The Neocons in the CPA have all sorts of ulterior motives and social experiments they want to impose on the Iraqi people , including Polish - style economic shock therapy , some sort of sweetheart deal for Israel , and maybe even breaking the country up into three parts .
<en=12>The Washington Monthly 's Who 's Who of Neocons in Iraq helps explain the extreme incompetence and possibly double - dealing of many in the CPA .
<en=13>Sept. 11 Commission member Philip Zelikow , who is close to the Bush administration , admitted on Sept. 10 , 2002 , that the ulterior motive of the Bush administration for the Iraq War was to " protect Israel , " according to the Asian Times .
<en=14>I have long been a trenchant critic of the Sadrists .
<en=15>But they have n't been up to anything extraordinary as far as I can see in recent weeks .
<en=16>Someone in the CPA sat down and thought up ways to stir them up by closing their newspaper and issuing 28 arrest warrants and taking in people like Yaqubi .
<en=17>This is either gross incompetence or was done with dark ulterior motives that can scarcely be guessed at .
<en=18>There is a classical logical fallacy , post hoc ergo propter hoc ( Z happens after X , therefore Z is caused by X ) , and I keep revising this posting this evening because I do n't want to fall into it .
<en=19>But sometimes , of course , when Z happens after X it is because of X .
<en=20>So I may as well just come out with it : It is pretty suspicious , given the Neocon predominance in the CPA and in the upper reaches of the Defense Department that on April 2 AP reported of Muqtada :
<en=21>' A radical Shiite Muslim cleric has expressed solidarity with the militant Palestinian group Hamas and said that he should be considered the group 's " striking arm " in Iraq .
<en=22>" I have said and I repeat my expression of solidarity which Hassan Nasrallah called for to stand with Hamas , " Shiite cleric Muqtada al - Sadr said Friday in a reference to Nasrallah , the leader of the militant Lebanese Shiite group Hezbollah .
<en=23>Last month , Nasrallah announced that his party would close ranks with Hamas .
<en=24>" Let ( Hamas ) consider me their striking arm in Iraq because the fate of Iraq and Palestine is the same , " al - Sadr said during a Friday prayer sermon in Kufa , his home base south of Baghdad .
<en=25>He did comment on what he meant by the phrase . '
<en=26>And on April 3 his chief aide in Najaf was suddenly arrested along with 13 other members of his organization , and the Coalition forces are put into violent conflict with his organization , which leaves 7 US soldiers dead .
<en=27>The Army is unlikely to forgive or forget ; but who provoked it and why ?
<en=28>I 'm not even in Iraq and I could have predicted to you the consequences of doing what the CPA has been doing .
<en=29>Anthony Shadid of the Washington Post reveals that the warrants for the arrests had been issued months be for .
<en=30>Why were they suddenly acted on Saturday ?
