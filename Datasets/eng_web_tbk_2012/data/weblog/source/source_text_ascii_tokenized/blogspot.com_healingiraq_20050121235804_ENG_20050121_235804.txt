<en=1>One week to elections day and the general atmosphere in the capital is eerie , yet strikingly familiar .
<en=2>I suspect the streets of Baghdad will look as if a war is looming this week .
<en=3>There is no doubt that many Iraqis regard the date of 30 January as a day of renewed hope , one they have been awaiting all their lives , but at the same time , many others are already dreading it .
<en=4>The interim government has promised security measures that would reduce the violence on the day of elections , but I fail to see how they will be able to protect all 5,000 ( or so ) balloting centres .
<en=5>Many voting centres have already been successfully attacked or destroyed in many areas .
<en=6>Now that the picture is clear , the two main competing lists seem to be the United Iraqi Coalition list and Allawi 's Al - Iraqiya list .
<en=7>Ayad Allawi , and other ministers running on his list , have quite expectedly used their governmental positions in campaigning .
<en=8>One minister reportedly handed out 100 dollar ' gifts ' to journalists attending a press conference for Allawi , a practice that brings back bad memories to many Iraqis .
<en=9>Sheikh Naji Al - Abbudi , a spokesman for Sistani , affirmed the claims that the Grand Ayatollah is backing the United Iraqi Coalition list .
<en=10>Indeed , Sistani 's agents all over the country have been quite active in educating Iraqi Shia on the merits of elections , which has led to the assassination of at least two of them .
<en=11>Al - Abbudi stated that " His Emminence " decided to openly support the list because " others " ( obviously a reference to Allawi ) have been abusing official state positions and media outlets in their campaigning .
<en=12>Again there is no official written statement from Sistani 's office confirming this allegation , which I think is intentional .
<en=13>Ahmed Al - Chalabi and defense minister Hazim Al - Sha'lan have been engaging in shrill public attacks over the media .
<en=14>Chalabi describing Sha'lan as a " Ba'athist " and a " former double agent for Saddam and the CIA " , while Sha'lan dismisses Chalabi as a " thief " and an " Iranian stooge who longs for his own origins by defending Iran " .
<en=15>One remark made by Sha'lan on Al - Arabiya TV , that he could n't say more about Chalabi because he would embarrass himself and the viewers almost made me roll on the floor .
<en=16>It was an extremely amusing episode , watching Chalabi looking smug and amused , contrasted with Sha'lan , all serious and barely keeping himself from swearing .
<en=17>Fistfights , please .
<en=18>Hazim Al - Sha'lan , by the way , is the son of the late Sheikh of Al - Khaza'il in Diwaniya and has the potential to replace former information minister , M.S. Al - Sahaf , in his nonsensical media statements , which can be passed as jokes .
<en=19>The main Kurdish coalition list ( PUK and KDP ) is barely mentioned outside the Kurdish region .
<en=20>Even there , many Kurds look and act as if they are going to grab the chance to vote them out of power .
<en=21>I doubt that will be the outcome though .
<en=22>Many Iraqis , including conservative and religious Iraqis , are surprisingly rooting for the Iraqi Communist party , probably in an attempt to counter the influence of Islamists in the forthcoming National Assembly .
<en=23>The Communist party has the largest number of registered party members in the country and can be considered as the oldest popular political party in Iraq .
<en=24>Its support base is much larger than what it seems .
<en=25>***
<en=26>Several candidates were assassinated and targeted these last two weeks , others have been forced under threats to withdraw and to follow the example of the Islamic party .
<en=27>Sectarian tensions are at their highest since April , 2004 , with Sunni insurgents now openly attacking Husseiniyas and Shia mosques .
<en=28>I had an interesting conversation with a middle - aged taxi driver who used to live in Fallujah and is now at relatives in Amiriya , Baghdad .
<en=29>After asking me which tribe I belong to ( thus assessing my sectarian background ) he started hurling abuses at the Shia , calling them Persians , Majoos ( fire worshippers ) , rabid dogs and a handful of other descriptions that I ca n't mention here .
<en=30>He described Allawi 's face as that of a f*ed horse and he dismissed the whole government as a band of thieves and traitors .
<en=31>I did n't argue with him but I asked him what he believed would be a viable solution to this mess .
<en=32>He said that resistance was the only commonsense solution .
<en=33>First driving out the Americans , then fighting the Shia back into submission ( as in 1991 ) .
<en=34>Sunni Iraqis contend that elections are impossible to hold under occupation .
<en=35>Leaving aside the fact that this views conflicts with other historical examples in the region , Sunnis have never offered an alternative choice , which eventually leads one to guess that the opinion held by the Fallujan taxi driver above is precisely what they are planning to implement .
<en=36>I had another conversation some months ago with a retired Ba'athist old - timer who claimed that Ba'athists have the means to stage a third coup d'etat and return to power within 10 hours of an American withdrawal .
<en=37>On sensing my incredulity to his statement he asserted that Ba'athist cells exist in all parts of the country and that they do have a central command , even though many have formed seperate cells ( often under Islamic labels ) with their own leaderships .
<en=38>He said that they have the training and the funding as well as the support of neighbouring and regional governments .
<en=39>I concur that Ba'athists and former security forces are capable of immediately controlling at least 5 out of 18 governorates , along with the capital , if Americans are to be removed from the picture entirely .
<en=40>But I also see that as a fatal misconception , which is doing Sunnis harm , because I do n't believe the US is going anywhere so soon .
<en=41>Any government that assumes power after the elections also realises this , so not even Sistani is going to call the US to withdraw its troops , despite what he is saying now , not until they are ensured the insurgency is out of the picture , or that they have an alternative foreign power ( in this case Iran ) to back them up .
<en=42>The only hope now is that , following the elections , the National Assembly would offer the hand of peace and reconciliation to the dissenting parties .
<en=43>I would suggest going for tribal Sheikhs rather than clerics , since they have the upper hand in their areas and can effectively root out any Ba'athists in their midst in return for a promise of sharing power and authority .
<en=44>Many of these Sheikhs have been disenfranchised and abused over the last two years .
<en=45>Very recently , US forces in Al - Anbar made a terrible blunder by accidentally killing Abdul - Razaq Inad Al - Gu'ud , Sheikh of the Al - Bu Nimr clan from the powerful Dulaym tribe .
<en=46>Al - Gu'ud had favoured elections and was in good terms with the government .
<en=47>The Gu'ud family even accepted to be offered the seat of Al - Anbar governor some months back .
<en=48>The Al - Bu Nimr in Ramadi and Al - Qaim rose in arms against Saddam in the mid-nineties following the execution of Thamir Madhlum Al - Dulaymi , an Air Force general belonging to their tribe .
<en=49>The revolt took two weeks to be suppressed by the Republican Guard .
<en=50>Another bad step was the recent arrest of Sheikh Hassan Al - Lihabi , of the Lihaib tribe which is scattered between the governorates of Al - Anbar , Mosul and Salah Al - Din .
<en=51>Al - Lihaibi was running in elections and is now said to have withdrawn following this incident .
<en=52>I believe national reconciliation to be the only path forward to a new Iraq .
<en=53>The Shia can not live without the Sunnis , and vice versa .
<en=54>Both have shared this country for the last 14 centuries and there is no possible way that one can live without the other .
<en=55>Even partition is not a possibility , there are no clear borders between the two .
