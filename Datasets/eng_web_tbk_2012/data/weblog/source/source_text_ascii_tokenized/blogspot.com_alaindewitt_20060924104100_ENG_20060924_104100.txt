<en=1>Thanks again to my friend Nick Keck for passing this along via e-mail .
<en=2>It is the text of a speech given by an Arab gentleman before the advisory board of a large multi-nation corporation .
<en=3>It 's a long but very worthwhile read .
<en=4>" A View from the Eye of the Storm "
<en=5>Talk delivered by Haim Harari at a meeting of the International Advisory Board of a large multi-national corporation , April , 2004 :
<en=6>" As you know , I usually provide the scientific and technological " entertainment " in our meetings , but , on this occasion , our Chairman suggested that I present my own personal view on events in the part of the world from which I come .
<en=7>I have never been and I will never be a Government official and I have no privileged information .
<en=8>My perspective is entirely based on what I see , on what I read and on the fact that my family has lived in this region for almost 200 years .
<en=9>You may regard my views as those of the proverbial taxi driver , which you are supposed to question , when you visit a country .
<en=10>I could have shared with you some fascinating facts and some personal thoughts about the Israeli - Arab conflict .
<en=11>However , I will touch upon it only in passing .
<en=12>I prefer to devote most of my remarks to the broader picture of the region and its place in world events .
<en=13>I refer to the entire area between Pakistan and Morocco , which is predominantly Arab , predominantly Moslem , but includes many non-Arab and also significant non-Moslem minorities .
<en=14>Why do I put aside Israel and its own immediate neighborhood ?
<en=15>Because Israel and any problems related to it , in spite of what you might read or hear in the world media , is not the central issue , and has never been the central issue in the upheaval in the region .
<en=16>Yes , there is a 100 year - old Israeli - Arab conflict , but it is not where the main show is .
<en=17>The millions who died in the Iran - Iraq war had nothing to do with Israel .
<en=18>The mass murder happening right now in Sudan , where the Arab Moslem regime is massacring its black Christian citizens , has nothing to do with Israel .
<en=19>The frequent reports from Algeria about the murders of hundreds of civilians in one village or another by other Algerians have nothing to do with Israel .
<en=20>Saddam Hussein did not invade Kuwait , endanger Saudi Arabia and butcher his own people because of Israel .
<en=21>Egypt did not use poison gas against Yemen in the 60's because of Israel .
<en=22>Assad the Father did not kill tens of thousands of his own citizens in one week in El Hamma in Syria because of Israel .
<en=23>The Taliban control of Afghanistan and the civil war there had nothing to do with Israel .
<en=24>The Libyan blowing up of the Pan - Am flight had nothing to do with Israel , and I could go on and on and on .
<en=25>The root of the trouble is that this entire Moslem region is totally dysfunctional , by any standard of the word , and would have been so even if Israel had joined the Arab league and an independent Palestine had existed for 100 years .
<en=26>The 22 member countries of the Arab league , from Mauritania to the Gulf States , have a total population of 300 millions , larger than the US and almost as large as the EU before its expansion .
<en=27>They have a land area larger than either the US or all of Europe .
<en=28>These 22 countries , with all their oil and natural resources , have a combined GDP smaller than that of Netherlands plus Belgium and equal to half of the GDP of California alone .
<en=29>Within this meager GDP , the gaps between rich and poor are beyond belief and too many of the rich made their money not by succeeding in business , but by being corrupt rulers .
<en=30>The social status of women is far below what it was in the Western World 150 years ago .
<en=31>Human rights are below any reasonable standard , in spite of the grotesque fact that Libya was elected Chair of the UN Human Rights commission .
<en=32>According to a report prepared by a committee of Arab intellectuals and published under the auspices of the U.N. , the number of books translated by the entire Arab world is much smaller than what little Greece alone translates .
<en=33>The total number of scientific publications of 300 million Arabs is less than that of 6 million Israelis .
<en=34>Birth rates in the region are very high , increasing the poverty , the social gaps and the cultural decline .
<en=35>And all of this is happening in a region , which only 30 years ago , was believed to be the next wealthy part of the world , and in a Moslem area , which developed , at some point in history , one of the most advanced cultures in the world .
<en=36>It is fair to say that this creates an unprecedented breeding ground for cruel dictators , terror networks , fanaticism , incitement , suicide murders and general decline .
<en=37>It is also a fact that almost everybody in the region blames this situation on the United States , on Israel , on Western Civilization , on Judaism and Christianity , on anyone and anything , except themselves .
<en=38>A word about the millions of decent , honest , good people who are either devout Moslems or are not very religious but grew up in Moslem families : They are double victims of an outside world , which now develops Islamophobia , and of their own environment which breaks their heart by being totally dysfunctional .
<en=39>The problem is that the vast silent majority of these Moslems are not part of the terror and the incitement , but they also do not stand up against it .
<en=40>They become accomplices , by omission , and this applies to political leaders , intellectuals , business people and many others .
<en=41>Many of them can certainly tell right from wrong , but are afraid to express their views .
<en=42>The events of the last few years have amplified four issues , which have always existed , but have never been as rampant as in the present upheaval in the region .
<en=43>A few more years may pass before everybody acknowledges that it is a World War , but we are already well into it .
<en=44>These are the four main pillars of the current World Conflict , or perhaps we should already refer to it as " the undeclared World War III " :
<en=45>* 1 . The first element is the suicide murder . *
<en=46>Suicide murders are not a new invention but they have been made popular , if I may use this expression , only lately .
<en=47>Even after September 11 , it seems that most of the Western World does not yet understand this weapon .
<en=48>It is a very potent psychological weapon .
<en=49>Its real direct impact is relatively minor .
<en=50>The total number of casualties from hundreds of suicide murders within Israel in the last three years is much smaller than those due to car accidents .
<en=51>September 11 was quantitatively much less lethal than many earthquakes
<en=52>More people die from AIDS in one day in Africa than all the Russians who died in the hands of Chechnya - based Moslem suicide murderers since that conflict started .
<en=53>Saddam killed every month more people than all those who died from suicide murders since the Coalition occupation of Iraq .
<en=54>So what is all the fuss about suicide killings ?
<en=55>It creates headlines .
<en=56>It is spectacular .
<en=57>It is frightening .
<en=58>It is a very cruel death with bodies dismembered and horrible severe lifelong injuries to many of the wounded .
<en=59>It is always shown on television in great detail .
<en=60>One such murder , with the help of hysterical media coverage , can destroy the tourism industry of a country for quite a while , as it did in Bali and in Turkey .
<en=61>But the real fear comes from the undisputed fact that no defense and no preventive measures can succeed against a determined suicide murderer .
<en=62>This has not yet penetrated the thinking of the Western World .
<en=63>The U.S. and Europe are constantly improving their defense against the last murder , not the next one .
<en=64>We may arrange for the best airport security in the world .
<en=65>But if you want to murder by suicide , you do not have to board a plane in order to explode yourself and kill many people .
<en=66>Who could stop a suicide murder in the midst of the crowded line waiting to be checked by the airport metal detector ?
<en=67>How about the lines to the check - in counters in a busy travel period ?
<en=68>Put a metal detector in front of every train station in Spain and the terrorists will get the buses .
<en=69>Protect the buses and they will explode in movie theaters , concert halls , supermarkets , shopping malls , schools and hospitals .
<en=70>Put guards in front of every concert hall and there will always be a line of people to be checked by the guards and this line will be the target , not to speak of killing the guards themselves .
<en=71>You can somewhat reduce your vulnerability by preventive and defensive measures and by strict border controls but not eliminate it and definitely not win the war in a defensive way .
<en=72>And it is a war !
<en=73>What is behind the suicide murders ?
<en=74>Money is , money and power and cold - blooded murderous incitement , nothing else .
<en=75>It has nothing to do with true fanatic religious beliefs .
<en=76>No Moslem preacher has ever blown himself up .
<en=77>No son of an Arab politician or religious leader has ever blown himself up .
<en=78>No relative of anyone influential has done it .
<en=79>Would n't you expect some of the religious leaders to do it themselves , or to talk their sons into doing it , if this is truly a supreme act of religious fervor ?
<en=80>Are n't they interested in the benefits of going to Heaven ?
<en=81>Instead , they send outcast women , naive children , retarded people and young incited hotheads .
<en=82>They promise them the delights , mostly sexual , of the next world , and pay their families handsomely after the supreme act is performed and enough innocent people are dead .
<en=83>Suicide murders also have nothing to do with poverty and despair .
<en=84>The poorest region in the world , by far , is Africa .
<en=85>It never happens there .
<en=86>There are numerous desperate people in the world , in different cultures , countries and continents .
<en=87>Desperation does not provide anyone with explosives , reconnaissance and transportation .
<en=88>There was certainly more despair in Saddam 's Iraq than in Paul Bremmer 's Iraq , and no one exploded himself .
<en=89>A suicide murder is simply a horrible , vicious weapon of cruel , inhuman , cynical , well - funded terrorists , with no regard to human life , including the life of their fellow countrymen , but with very high regard to their own affluent well - being and their hunger for power .
<en=90>The only way to fight this new " popular " weapon is identical to the only way in which you fight organized crime or pirates on the high seas : the offensive way .
<en=91>Like in the case of organized crime , it is crucial that the forces on the offensive be united and it is crucial to reach the top of the crime pyramid .
<en=92>You can not eliminate organized crime by arresting the little drug dealer on the street corner .
<en=93>You must go after the head of the " Family " .
<en=94>If part of the public supports it , others tolerate it , many are afraid of it and some try to explain it away by poverty or by a miserable childhood , organized crime will thrive and so will terrorism .
<en=95>The United States understands this now , after September 11 .
<en=96>Russia is beginning to understand it .
<en=97>Turkey understands it well .
<en=98>I am very much afraid that most of Europe still does not understand it .
<en=99>Unfortunately , it seems that Europe will understand it only after suicide murders arrive in Europe in a big way .
<en=100>In my humble opinion , this will definitely happen .
<en=101>The Spanish trains and the Istanbul bombings are only the beginning .
<en=102>The unity of the Civilized World in fighting this horror is absolutely indispensable .
<en=103>Until Europe wakes up , this unity will not be achieved .
<en=104>* 2 . The second ingredient is words , more precisely lies . *
<en=105>Words can be lethal .
<en=106>They kill people .
<en=107>It is often said that politicians , diplomats and perhaps also lawyers and business people must sometimes lie , as part of their professional life .
<en=108>But the norms of politics and diplomacy are childish , in comparison with the level of incitement and total absolute deliberate fabrications , which have reached new heights in the region we are talking about .
<en=109>An incredible number of people in the Arab world believe that September 11 never happened , or was an American provocation or , even better , a Jewish plot .
<en=110>You all remember the Iraqi Minister of Information , Mr. Mouhamad Said al - Sahaf and his press conferences when the US forces were already inside Baghdad .
<en=111>Disinformation at time of war is an accepted tactic .
<en=112>But to stand , day after day , and to make such preposterous statements , known to everybody to be lies , without even being ridiculed in your own milieu , can only happen in this region .
<en=113>Mr. Sahaf eventually became a popular icon as a court jester , but this did not stop some allegedly respectable newspapers from giving him equal time .
<en=114>It also does not prevent the Western press from giving credence , every day , even now , to similar liars .
<en=115>After all , if you want to be an anti-Semite , there are subtle ways of doing it .
<en=116>You do not have to claim that the holocaust never happened , and that the Jewish temple in Jerusalem never existed .
<en=117>But millions of Moslems are told by their leaders that this is the case .
<en=118>When these same leaders make other statements , the Western media report them as if they could be true .
<en=119>It is a daily occurrence that the same people who finance , arm and dispatch suicide murderers , condemn the act in English in front of western TV cameras , talking to a world audience , which even partly believes them .
<en=120>It is a daily routine to hear the same leader making opposite statements in Arabic to his people and in English to the rest of the world .
<en=121>Incitement by Arab TV , accompanied by horror pictures of mutilated bodies , has become a powerful weapon of those who lie , distort and want to destroy everything .
<en=122>Little children are raised on deep hatred and on admiration of so - called martyrs , and the Western World does not notice it because its own TV sets are mostly tuned to soap operas and game shows .
<en=123>I recommend to you , even though most of you do not understand Arabic , to watch Al Jazeera , from time to time .
<en=124>You will not believe your own eyes .
<en=125>But words also work in other ways , more subtle .
<en=126>A demonstration in Berlin , carrying banners supporting Saddam 's regime and featuring three - year old babies dressed as suicide murderers , is defined by the press and by political leaders as a " peace demonstration " .
<en=127>You may support or oppose the Iraq war , but to refer to fans of Saddam , Arafat or Bin Laden as peace activists is a bit too much .
<en=128>A woman walks into an Israeli restaurant in mid-day , eats , observes families with old people and children eating their lunch in the adjacent tables and pays the bill .
<en=129>She then blows herself up , killing 20 people , including many children , with heads and arms rolling around in the restaurant .
<en=130>She is called " martyr " by several Arab leaders and " activist " by the European press .
<en=131>Dignitaries condemn the act but visit her bereaved family and the money flows .
<en=132>There is a new game in town : The actual murderer is called " the military wing " , the one who pays him , equips him and sends him is now called " the political wing " and the head of the operation is called the " spiritual leader " .
<en=133>There are numerous other examples of such Orwellian nomenclature , used every day not only by terror chiefs but also by Western media .
<en=134>These words are much more dangerous than many people realize .
<en=135>They provide an emotional infrastructure for atrocities .
<en=136>It was Joseph Goebbels who said that if you repeat a lie often enough , people will believe it .
<en=137>He is now being outperformed by his successors .
<en=138>* 3 . The third aspect is money . *
<en=139>Huge amounts of money , which could have solved many social problems in this dysfunctional part of the world , are channeled into three concentric spheres supporting death and murder .
<en=140>In the inner circle are the terrorists themselves .
<en=141>The money funds their travel , explosives , hideouts and permanent search for soft vulnerable targets .
<en=142>The inner circles are primarily financed by terrorist states like Iran and Syria , until recently also by Iraq and Libya and earlier also by some of the Communist regimes .
<en=143>These states , as well as the Palestinian Authority , are the safe havens of the wholesale murder vendors .
<en=144>They are surrounded by a second wider circle of direct supporters , planners , commanders , preachers , all of whom make a living , usually a very comfortable living , by serving as terror infrastructure .
<en=145>Finally , we find the third circle of so - called religious , educational and welfare organizations , which actually do some good , feed the hungry and provide some schooling , but brainwash a new generation with hatred , lies and ignorance .
<en=146>This circle operates mostly through mosques , madrasas and other religious establishments but also through inciting electronic and printed media .
<en=147>It is this circle that makes sure that women remain inferior , that democracy is unthinkable and that exposure to the outside world is minimal .
<en=148>It is also that circle that leads the way in blaming everybody outside the Moslem world , for the miseries of the region .
<en=149>The outer circle is largely financed by Saudi Arabia , but also by donations from certain Moslem communities in the United States and Europe and , to a smaller extent , by donations of European Governments to various NGO's and by certain United Nations organizations , whose goals may be noble , but they are infested and exploited by agents of the outer circle .
<en=150>The Saudi regime , of course , will be the next victim of major terror , when the inner circle will explode into the outer circle .
<en=151>The Saudis are beginning to understand it , but they fight the inner circles , while still financing the infrastructure at the outer circle .
<en=152>Figuratively speaking , this outer circle is the guardian , which makes sure that the people look and listen inwards to the inner circle of terror and incitement , rather than to the world outside .
<en=153>Some parts of this same outer circle actually operate as a result of fear from , or blackmail by , the inner circles .
<en=154>The horrifying added factor is the high birth rate .
<en=155>Half of the population of the Arab world is under the age of 20 , the most receptive age to incitement , guaranteeing two more generations of blind hatred .
<en=156>Some of the leaders of these various circles live very comfortably on their loot .
<en=157>You meet their children in the best private schools in Europe , not in the training camps of suicide murderers .
<en=158>The Jihad " soldiers " join packaged death tours to Iraq and other hotspots , while some of their leaders ski in Switzerland .
<en=159>Mrs. Arafat , who lives in Paris with her daughter , receives tens of thousands of dollars per month from the allegedly bankrupt Palestinian Authority , while a typical local ringleader of the Al - Aksa brigade , reporting to Arafat , receives only a cash payment of a couple of hundred dollars , for performing murders at the retail level .
<en=160>* 4 . The fourth element of the current world conflict is the total breaking of all laws . *
<en=161>The civilized world believes in democracy , the rule of law , including international law , human rights , free speech and free press , among other liberties .
<en=162>There are naive old - fashioned habits such as respecting religious sites and symbols , not using ambulances and hospitals for acts of war , avoiding the mutilation of dead bodies and not using children as human shields or human bombs .
<en=163>Never in history , not even in the Nazi period , was there such total disregard of all of the above as we observe now .
<en=164>Every student of political science debates how you prevent an anti-democratic force from winning a democratic election and abolishing democracy .
<en=165>Other aspects of a civilized society must also have limitations .
<en=166>Can a policeman open fire on someone trying to kill him ?
<en=167>Can a government listen to phone conversations of terrorists and drug dealers ?
<en=168>Does free speech protect you when you shout " fire " in a crowded theater ?
<en=169>Should there be death penalty , for deliberate multiple murders ?
<en=170>These are the old - fashioned dilemmas .
<en=171>But now we have an entire new set .
<en=172>Do you raid a mosque , which serves as a terrorist ammunition storage ?
<en=173>Do you return fire , if you are attacked from a hospital ?
<en=174>Do you storm a church taken over by terrorists who took the priests hostages ?
<en=175>Do you search every ambulance after a few suicide murderers use ambulances to reach their targets ?
<en=176>Do you strip every woman because one pretended to be pregnant and carried a suicide bomb on her belly ?
<en=177>Do you shoot back at someone trying to kill you , standing deliberately behind a group of children ?
<en=178>Do you raid terrorist headquarters , hidden in a mental hospital ?
<en=179>Do you shoot an arch-murderer who deliberately moves from one location to another , always surrounded by children ?
<en=180>All of these happen daily in Iraq and in the Palestinian areas .
<en=181>What do you do ?
<en=182>Well , you do not want to face the dilemma .
<en=183>But it can not be avoided .
<en=184>Suppose , for the sake of discussion , that someone would openly stay in a well - known address in Teheran , hosted by the Iranian Government and financed by it , executing one atrocity after another in Spain or in France , killing hundreds of innocent people , accepting responsibility for the crimes , promising in public TV interviews to do more of the same , while the Government of Iran issues public condemnations of his acts but continues to host him , invite him to official functions and treat him as a great dignitary .
<en=185>I leave it to you as homework to figure out what Spain or France would have done , in such a situation .
<en=186>The problem is that the civilized world is still having illusions about the rule of law in a totally lawless environment .
<en=187>It is trying to play ice hockey by sending a ballerina ice - skater into the ring or to knock out a heavyweight boxer by a chess player .
<en=188>In the same way that no country has a law against cannibals eating its prime minister , because such an act is unthinkable , international law does not address killers shooting from hospitals , mosques and ambulances , while being protected by their Government or society .
<en=189>International law does not know how to handle someone who sends children to throw stones , stands behind them and shoots with immunity and can not be arrested because he is sheltered by a Government .
<en=190>International law does not know how to deal with a leader of murderers who is royally and comfortably hosted by a country , which pretends to condemn his acts or just claims to be too weak to arrest him .
<en=191>The amazing thing is that all of these crooks demand protection under international law , and define all those who attack them as " war criminals , " with some Western media repeating the allegations .
<en=192>The good news is that all of this is temporary , because the evolution of international law has always adapted itself to reality .
<en=193>The punishment for suicide murder should be death or arrest before the murder , not during and not after .
<en=194>After every world war , the rules of international law have changed , and the same will happen after the present one .
<en=195>But during the twilight zone , a lot of harm can be done .
<en=196>The picture I described here is not pretty .
<en=197>What can we do about it ?
<en=198>In the short run , only fight and win .
<en=199>In the long run , only educate the next generation and open it to the world .
<en=200>The inner circles can and must be destroyed by force .
<en=201>The outer circle can not be eliminated by force .
<en=202>Here we need financial starvation of the organizing elite , more power to women , more education , counter-propaganda , boycott whenever feasible and access to Western media , internet and the international scene .
<en=203>Above all , we need a total absolute unity and determination of the civilized world against all three circles of evil .
<en=204>Allow me , for a moment , to depart from my alleged role as a taxi driver and return to science .
<en=205>When you have a malignant tumor , you may remove the tumor itself surgically .
<en=206>You may also starve it by preventing new blood from reaching it from other parts of the body , thereby preventing new " supplies " from expanding the tumor .
<en=207>If you want to be sure , it is best to do both .
<en=208>But before you fight and win , by force or otherwise , you have to realize that you are in a war , and this may take Europe a few more years .
<en=209>In order to win , it is necessary to first eliminate the terrorist regimes , so that no Government in the world will serve as a safe haven for these people .
<en=210>I do not want to comment here on whether the American - led attack on Iraq was justified from the point of view of weapons of mass destruction or any other pre-war argument , but I can look at the post-war map of Western Asia .
<en=211>Now that Afghanistan , Iraq and Libya are out , two and a half terrorist states remain : Iran , Syria and Lebanon , the latter being a Syrian colony .
<en=212>Perhaps Sudan should be added to the list .
<en=213>As a result of the conquest of Afghanistan and Iraq , both Iran and Syria are now totally surrounded by territories unfriendly to them .
<en=214>Iran is encircled by Afghanistan , by the Gulf States , Iraq and the Moslem republics of the former Soviet Union .
<en=215>Syria is surrounded by Turkey , Iraq , Jordan and Israel .
<en=216>This is a significant strategic change and it applies strong pressure on the terrorist countries .
<en=217>It is not surprising that Iran is so active in trying to incite a Shiite uprising in Iraq .
<en=218>I do not know if the American plan was actually to encircle both Iran and Syria , but that is the resulting situation .
<en=219>In my humble opinion , the number one danger to the world today is Iran and its regime .
<en=220>It definitely has ambitions to rule vast areas and to expand in all directions .
<en=221>It has an ideology which claims supremacy over Western culture .
<en=222>It is ruthless .
<en=223>It has proven that it can execute elaborate terrorist acts without leaving too many traces , using Iranian Embassies .
<en=224>It is clearly trying to develop nuclear weapons .
<en=225>Its so - called moderates and conservatives play their own virtuoso version of the " good - cop versus bad - cop " game .
<en=226>Iran sponsors Syrian terrorism , it is certainly behind much of the action in Iraq , it is fully funding the Hezbollah and , through it , the Palestinian Hamas and Islamic Jihad ; it performed acts of terror at least in Europe and in South America and probably also in Uzbekistan and Saudi Arabia and it truly leads a multi-national terror consortium , which includes , as minor players , Syria , Lebanon and certain Shiite elements in Iraq .
<en=227>Nevertheless , most European countries still trade with Iran , try to appease it and refuse to read the clear signals .
<en=228>In order to win the war it is also necessary to dry the financial resources of the terror conglomerate .
<en=229>It is pointless to try to understand the subtle differences between the Sunni terror of Al Qaeda and Hamas and the Shiite terror of Hezbollah , Sadr and other Iranian - inspired enterprises .
<en=230>When it serves their business needs , all of them collaborate beautifully .
<en=231>It is crucial to stop Saudi and other financial support of the outer circle , which is the fertile breeding ground of terror .
<en=232>It is important to monitor all donations from the Western World to Islamic organizations , to monitor the finances of international relief organizations and to react with forceful economic measures to any small sign of financial aid to any of the three circles of terrorism .
<en=233>It is also important to act decisively against the campaign of lies and fabrications and to monitor those Western media who collaborate with it out of naivety , financial interests or ignorance .
<en=234>Above all , never surrender to terror .
<en=235>No one will ever know whether the recent elections in Spain would have yielded a different result , if not for the train bombings a few days earlier .
<en=236>But it really does not matter .
<en=237>What matters is that the terrorists believe that they caused the result and that they won by driving Spain out of Iraq .
<en=238>The Spanish story will surely end up being extremely costly to other European countries , including France , who is now expelling inciting preachers and forbidding veils and including others who sent troops to Iraq .
<en=239>In the long run , Spain itself will pay even more .
<en=240>Is the solution a democratic Arab world ?
<en=241>If by democracy we mean free elections but also free press , free speech , a functioning judicial system , civil liberties , equality to women , free international travel , exposure to international media and ideas , laws against racial incitement and against defamation , and avoidance of lawless behavior regarding hospitals , places of worship and children , then yes , democracy is the solution .
<en=242>If democracy is just free elections , it is likely that the most fanatic regime will be elected , the one whose incitement and fabrications are the most inflammatory .
<en=243>We have seen it already in Algeria and , to a certain extent , in Turkey .
<en=244>It will happen again , if the ground is not prepared very carefully .
<en=245>On the other hand , a certain transition democracy , as in Jordan , may be a better temporary solution , paving the way for the real thing , perhaps in the same way that an immediate sudden democracy did not work in Russia and would not have worked in China .
<en=246>I have no doubt that the civilized world will prevail .
<en=247>But the longer it takes us to understand the new landscape of this war , the more costly and painful the victory will be .
<en=248>Europe , more than any other region , is the key .
<en=249>Its understandable recoil from wars , following the horrors of World War II , may cost thousands of additional innocent lives , before the tide will turn . "
