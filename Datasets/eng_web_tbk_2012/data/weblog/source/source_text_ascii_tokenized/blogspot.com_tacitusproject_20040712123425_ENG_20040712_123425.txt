<en=1>Though I am loathe to quote other writers at legnth in this space , this little bit from Dan Froomkin 's " White House Briefing " column in the WashPost today is just too good to pass up ( read the whole column here ) :
<en=2>At the Ask the President event on Friday , one of the questions was about whether Bush has any thoughts about his memoirs .
<en=3>This is one example of what happens when Bush gets a question that he has n't anticipated .
<en=4>" Q Thank you -- I was wondering , there 's a lot of talk right now about memoirs being written with the former President .
<en=5>After you are elected in 2004 , what will your memoirs say about you , what will the title be , and what will the main theme say ?
<en=6>" THE PRESIDENT : I appreciate that .
<en=7>( Laughter . )
<en=8>There is a painting on my wall in the Oval -- first of all , I do n't know .
<en=9>I 'm just speculating now .
<en=10>I really have n't thought about writing a book .
<en=11>My life is too complicated right now trying to do my job .
<en=12>( Laughter . )
<en=13>But if -- there 's a painting on the wall in the Oval Office that shows a horseman charging up a steep cliff , and there are at least two other horsemen following .
<en=14>It 's a Western scene by a guy named W.H.S. Koerner called ' A Charge to Keep . '
<en=15>It 's on loan , by the way , from a guy named Joe O'Neill in Midland , Texas .
<en=16>He was the person , he and his wife Jan , introduced -- reintroduced me and Laura in his backyard in July of 1977 .
<en=17>Four months later , we were married .
<en=18>So he 's got a -- I 'm a decision - maker and I can make good decisions .
<en=19>( Applause . )
<en=20>" And so we sang this hymn -- this is a long story trying to get to your answer .
<en=21>( Laughter . )
<en=22>This is not a filibuster .
<en=23>( Laughter . )
<en=24>That 's a Senate term -- particularly on good judges .
<en=25>( Applause . )
<en=26>The hymn was sung at my first inaugural church service as governor .
<en=27>Laura and I are Methodists .
<en=28>One of the Wesley boys wrote the hymn .
<en=29>The painting is based upon the hymn called , ' A Charge to Keep . '
<en=30>I have .
<en=31>The hymn talks about serving something greater than yourself in life .
<en=32>I -- which I try to do , as best as I possibly can .
<en=33>( Applause . )
<en=34>" The book -- I guess one way , one thing to think about it is -- one of the themes would be , I was given a charge to keep .
<en=35>And I gave it all my heart , all my energy , based upon principles that did not change once I got into the Oval Office .
<en=36>( Applause . ) "
<en=37>Now that 's a rambling response .
<en=38>And I have to wonder : Did he forget that he already has a memoir called " A Charge to Keep " ?
<en=39>That was the name of his " autobiography " -- ghost - written by adviser Karen Hughes in 1999 .
