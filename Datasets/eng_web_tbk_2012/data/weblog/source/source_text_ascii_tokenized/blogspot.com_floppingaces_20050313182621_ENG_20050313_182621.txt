<en=1>Bill over at The Fourth Rail has an excellent essay on how the MSM and the UN , even the leftist countries in Europe , are basically accepting terrorist organizations as legitimate forms of a political party :
<en=2>On the same day Palestinians protest in support of Hezbollah and Syria , the terrorist group Hamas has indicated it will participate in the scheduled upcoming Parliamentary elections .
<en=3>To the north in Lebanon , there is serious debate within Hezbollah about entering the Lebanese political process in light of Syria 's promised withdrawal .
<en=4>Syria has agreed to withdraw under the conditions set forth in UNSC Resolution 1559 , which has already begun .
<en=5>UN Secretary - General Kofi Annan has indicated it is time to " recognize Hezbollah " after easily being duped by " the message on the placards they are using " .
<en=6>This acceptance of blatantly terrorist groups as legitimate freedom movements is a cancerous tumor on the United Nations and the media .
<en=7>Over three years after 9-11 , the United Nations , despite their attempts to project strength in fighting terrorism , still can not properly define the word " terrorist " , waffling over the issue of whether the murder of innocent civilians are terrorist acts .
<en=8>The media routinely obscures the lines between terrorism and legitimate resistance , as the recent article by Daniel Okrent of The New York Times demonstrates .
<en=9>...
<en=10>The decision to sidestep the obvious to satisfy the need to avoid confrontation does not bring peace , but only delays the eventual conflict as the predators of Hamas and Hezbollah exploit the inherent weakness of the internationals and the media .
<en=11>I 've been fuming over this fact for a few weeks now , ever since some organizations and governments suggested we need to accept the fact that Hezbollah will get involved in running Lebanon .
<en=12>Wtf is this ?
<en=13>This is a terrorist organization plain and simple .
<en=14>This is the organization that bombed our Marine barracks in 1983 , took Americans hostage throughout the 80's and now they should be considered a legitimate organization ?
<en=15>This is just another reason to never trust the MSM , and certainly not the Europeans .
