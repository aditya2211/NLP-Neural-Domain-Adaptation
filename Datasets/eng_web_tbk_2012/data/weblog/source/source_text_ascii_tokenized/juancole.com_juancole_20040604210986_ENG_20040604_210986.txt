<en=4>As the American public gradually wearies of the Iraq crisis , some have begun worrying that the war could blow back on the US by creating the conditions for anti-American terrorism .
<en=5>Israel , however , is much closer to Iraq and is likely to suffer from Iraqi instability much more acutely than will the United States .
<en=6>Ironically , among the strongest proponents of war in Iraq were Israeli Prime Minister Ariel Sharon and his neoconservative supporters in the US .
<en=7>Have they , however , actually weakened Israeli security ?
<en=8>The biggest threat Israel faces is not from conventional armies but from the asymmetrical tactics of Palestinian national liberation movements .
<en=9>The derailing of the Oslo peace process by the hard - line policies of Sharon and the Palestinian intifada has encouraged suicide bombings .
<en=10>This , in turn , has discouraged international investment in Israel and has made it less likely that immigrants to the country will actually remain there .
<en=11>Although Israel withdrew from Lebanese territory in May 2000 , the radical Lebanese Shiite party , Hizbullah , has not been mollified .
<en=12>It is estimated to have some 5,000 armed fighters , and they have pursued attacks against Israeli forces to compel them to withdraw from the Shebaa Farms , a sliver of Syrian territory that Israel annexed after the 1967 war .
<en=13>Any thorough assessment of the impact of the Iraq war and its aftermath on Israel 's security environment must , therefore , closely examine its likely effect on the conduct of asymmetrical warfare .
<en=14>Although it is often alleged ( without much evidence ) that Saddam Hussein gave money to the families of Palestinian suicide bombers and so encouraged asymmetrical warfare , it is not clear that he actually posed a danger to Israel .
<en=15>The Palestinians who have been willing to kill themselves to end the Israeli occupation of the Gaza Strip and the West Bank were not driven by economic considerations .
<en=16>Saddam never did anything practical to help the Palestinians .
<en=17>At some points , as in the late 1980s , he reportedly made behind - the - scenes overtures to the Israelis to arrive at some sort of a deal .
<en=18>He did not allow Palestinian radicals to launch operations against Israel from Iraq .
<en=19>By the late 1990s , Iraq had no nuclear or biological weapons program , and had destroyed its chemical weapons stockpiles .
<en=20>Its ramshackle army had virtually collapsed before the American invasion in 2003 .
<en=21>If it is hard to see how Baathist Iraq posed any real threat to Israel , it is not so difficult to see a menace in the current instability .
<en=22>The bungling of post-war Iraq by the Bush administration created a weak and failed state .
<en=23>Armed militias , many staffed by former Iraqi military men with substantial training and experience , have proliferated .
<en=24>The US chose to ally itself with such groups as the Supreme Council for the Islamic Revolution in Iraq , whose 15,000 - strong Badr Corps paramilitary was trained by the Iranian Revolutionary Guards .
<en=25>Anti-Israeli and pro-Palestinian feeling is strong among several major Iraqi ideological groups and currents .
<en=26>The more radical Shiites , who generally follow the theocratic notions of Iran 's Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini , routinely chant and demonstrate against Israel .
<en=27>They vehemently protested the Israeli assassination of Sheikh Ahmed Yassin , the leader of Hamas , last March .
<en=28>Worse for Israel , the assassination drew a denunciation even from the moderate and cautious Grand Ayatollah Ali Sistani , who wields enormous moral authority over Iraqi Shiites .
<en=29>These Shiite movements had been suppressed by Saddam Hussein 's regime , but have now organized and armed themselves .
<en=30>They have also reestablished their historical links with Lebanese and Iranian Shiites .
<en=31>It is inevitable that most Iraqi Shiites will side with their Hizbullah coreligionists against Israel , and it seems likely that Iraqi Shiites will get rich enough from Iraqi petroleum sales in the future that they will be in a good position to bankroll Lebanese Shiite radicals .
<en=32>Sunni Arab fundamentalists deeply sympathize with the Palestinians and with Hamas , and those in Iraq have deep historical inks with fundamentalists in Jordan and Palestine .
<en=33>Iraqi cities such as Fallujah and Ramadi were on the truck route from Amman to Baghdad , and so came under the influence of the Salafi movement , which is popular in Jordan .
<en=34>Secular Arab nationalist groups also universally sympathize with the Palestinians , and those in post-Saddam Iraq are no exception .
<en=35>Whereas Saddam Hussein 's dictatorship ensured that such populist currents were kept firmly under control , they are now free to organize .
<en=36>An Iraq in which armed fundamentalist and nationalist militias proliferate is inevitably a security worry for Israel .
<en=37>If even a modicum of normality and security can be returned to Iraq , its citizens will be able to benefit from the country 's petroleum reserves .
<en=38>That private wealth can easily be funneled into aid for the Palestinians and for Lebanese Shiites .
<en=39>Israel 's security interests are best served by peace with its neighbors , which can only be achieved by trading land for peace with the Palestinians .
<en=40>Ariel Sharon 's aggressive near annexation of almost half of the occupied West Bank and his indefinite postponement of any Palestinian state have created unprecedented rage and violence .
<en=41>The anger has spread throughout the Muslim world , including Iraq .
<en=42>The promotion by the pro-Zionist right of twin occupations - in the West Bank and in Iraq - has profoundly weakened , not strengthened , Israeli security .
