<en=1>Elena 's motorcycle tour through the region around Chernobyl has revived interest in one of the most serious nuclear disasters in history .
<en=2>We all know what happened , but even to this day , there are many different versions and opinions on how it happened and what effect Chernobyl will have on the health of people affected by the fallout .
<en=3>UPDATE :
<en=4>Now you can tour Chernobyl and write your own story .
<en=5>This is not a post about fault - finding or assigning blame .
<en=6>It is a time to learn what happened and how it may affect the future .
<en=7>There was a soothing authoritative UNSCEAR ( United Nations Scientific Committee on the Effects of Atomic Radiation ) report in 2000 on the health effects of Chernobyl confirming that there was no scientific evidence of any significant radiation - related health effects to most people exposed .
<en=8>This was heavily promoted by the Australasian Radiation Protection Society in a press release titled THE MYTHS OF CHERNOBYL which contained the following :
<en=9>One of the most widespread myths of recent times is that the Chernobyl nuclear reactor accident in 1986 caused many thousands of extra cancer deaths in neighbouring regions , and that public health has been severely affected by exposure to radiation .
<en=10>Many people still believe that to be true , even though the Ministry of Russian Federation on Civil Defence , Emergencies and Elimination of Conseguences of Natural Disasters ( EMERCOM of Russia ) reported this in 1996 :
<en=11>CHERNOBYL ACCIDENT : TEN YEARS ON
<en=12>In the last decade , there has been a real and significant increase in childhood and , to a certain extent , adult carcinoma of the thyroid in contaminated regions of the former Soviet Union ( Wi940 ) which should be attributed to the Chernobyl accident until proven otherwise .
<en=13>The prestigious IAEA ( International Atomic Energy Agency ) published an early report on Chernobyl which was based on information from Russian sources and stated that there was no significant health effects .
<en=14>However , in April 2001 , the IAEA published Fifteen Years after the Chernobyl Accident - Lessons learned . which contradict the earlier reports .
<en=15>Here are some excerpts :
<en=16>The dramatic increase in radiation - induced thyroid cancers in children and adolescents in Belarus , Russia , and Ukraine , which have been observed since 1991 , continues to this day .
<en=17>... a drop in the birth rate , a deterioration in women 's reproductive health , an increase in complications during pregnancy and birth , and a deterioration in neonatal health ....
<en=18>The dynamics of change in the state of health of children affected by the Chernobyl accident in all three countries - Belarus , Russia , and Ukraine - in the post-accident period is characterized by persistent negative tendencies : the morbidity rate is going up , the number of really healthy children is dropping , and disability is increasing .
<en=19>As a parent , I can well imagine how painful it must be for those families whose children are succumbing to radiation poisoning .
<en=20>There is a lot to learn about Chernobyl .
<en=21>Being well - informed will give you certainty and that is desirable in a world of conflicting reports .
<en=22>There are a wealth of references on Chernobyl .
<en=23>Read some of the following links and draw your own conclusions .
<en=24>These links present the many viewpoints that existed and still exist about the disaster called Chernobyl :

<en=51>I would be interested in hearing what conclusions you reached and what you found that was most convincing .
<en=52>radiation :
<en=53>As a child in the 50's I had a lot of glandular problems and they treated it with radiation therapy ( primitive at best ! ) and stopped when a lesion on my neck started enlarging -- they said it was not CA but stopped the treatments ....
<en=54>Remember the old shoe sizing machines that was a form of radiation xray ?
<en=55>That too was stopped .
<en=56>Do n't have to mention what radiation has done and is still doing to Hirsohima & Nagaski folks -- there can be no doubts about the effects of radiation in Chernobyl .......
<en=57>The Chernobyl Children 's Project ( http://www.adiccp.org/home/default.asp ) offers several ways to help the children of that region .
<en=58>One of them is the Rest and Recuperation Program , wherein a child can come to the US for a few weeks in the summer .
<en=59>Even a little time spent receiving wholesome , uncontaminated food , good medical care , etc. can add years to their lives .
<en=60>S. and I have an acquaintance who has hosted several of these children for many years ; to see these little ones breaks the heart .
<en=61>The urge to protect and gather them all in is almost overwhelming , and makes me more grateful for the blessings I have .
<en=62>Take care , my friend , Linda
<en=63>I 'm sorry to say Elena 's story has been revealed to be a fake .
