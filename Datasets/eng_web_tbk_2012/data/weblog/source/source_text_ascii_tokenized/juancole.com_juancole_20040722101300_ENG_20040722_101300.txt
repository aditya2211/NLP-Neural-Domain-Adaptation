<en=1>The September 11 Panel will issue its findings on Thursday .
<en=2>It notes 10 points at which the US made key mistakes that might have stopped Bin Laden 's plot .
<en=3>Four of these were under Clinton and 6 under Bush .
<en=4>Bush came out today and said that if he had known what was coming , he would have expended every effort to stop it , and that so would have Clinton .
<en=5>This statement is , despite its facade of fair - mindedness , so many weasel words .
<en=6>Of course Bush would have tried to stop 9/11 if he had known it was coming .
<en=7>The question is , " Should he have known it was coming ? "
<en=8>The answer is , " Yes ! "
<en=9>We now know that Bush and his administration came into office obsessed with Iraq .
<en=10>Cheney was looking at maps of Iraq oil fields and muttering about opportunities for US companies there , already in January or February of 2001 .
<en=11>Wolfowitz contradicted counter-terrorism czar Richard Clarke when the latter spoke of the al - Qaeda threat , insisting that the preeminent threat of terrorism against the US came from Iraq , and indicating he accepted Laurie Mylroie 's crackpot conspiracy theory that Saddam was behind the 1993 World Trade Towers bombing .
<en=12>If you believe crackpot theories instead of focusing on the reality -- that was an al - Qaeda operation mainly carried out by al - Gamaa al - Islamiyyah , an Egyptian terrorist component allied with Bin Laden -- then you will concentrate on the wrong threat .
<en=13>Even after the attacks on September 11 , Bush was obsessing about Iraq .
<en=14>Wolfowitz lied to him and said that there was a 10 to 50 % chance that Iraq was behind them .
<en=15>( On what evidence ?
<en=16>The hijackers were obviously al - Qaeda , and no operational links between al - Qaeda and Iraq had ever been found ) .
<en=17>Rumsfeld initially rejected an attack on al - Qaeda bases in Afghanistan , saying there were " no good targets " in Afghanistan .
<en=18>( What about 40 al - Qaeda bases that had trained the 9/11 hijackers and other terrorists gunning for the United States ?? )
<en=19>The Pentagon did not even have a plan for dealing with Afghanistan or al - Qaeda that it could pull off the shelf , according to Bob Woodward .
<en=20>Bush did not have his eye on the ball .
<en=21>Neither did Cheney , Rumsfeld , or Wolfowitz .
<en=22>They were playing Captain Ahab to Saddam 's great white whale .
<en=23>Imperial Hubris makes the case that lots of people in the CIA and counter-terrorism divisions elsewhere in the US government knew all about Bin Laden and the threat he posed .
<en=24>They were from all accounts marginalized and not listened to .
<en=25>Bush demoted Dick Clarke , among the most vocal and focused of the al - Qaeda experts , from his cabinet .
<en=26>Dick could never thereafter get any real cooperation from the cabinet officers , who outranked him , and he could not convince them to go to battle stations in the summer of 2001 when George Tenet 's hair was " on fire " about the excited chatter the CIA was picking up from radical Islamist terrorists .
<en=27>As for the Clinton administration , let me say one thing in its defense .
<en=28>Clinton had worked out a deal with Pakistani Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif in summer of 1999 that would have allowed the US to send a Special Ops team in after Bin Laden in Qandahar , based from Pakistan .
<en=29>I presume you need the Pakistan base for rescue operations in case anything went wrong .
<en=30>You also need Pakistani air space .
<en=31>The plan was all set and could have succeeded .
<en=32>But in fall of 1999 , Gen. Pervez Musharraf made a coup against Nawaz Sharif .
<en=33>The Pakistani army was rife with elements protective of the Taliban , and the new military government reneged on the deal .
<en=34>Musharraf told Clinton he could n't use Pakistani soil or air space to send the team in against Bin Laden .
<en=35>Look at a map and you try to figure out how , in fall of 1999 , you could possibly pull off such an operation without Pakistani facilities .
<en=36>Of course , you could just go in by main force .
<en=37>But for those of you tempted in that direction , please look up Carter 's Tabas operation .
<en=38>It should be easily googled .
<en=39>Clinton tried , and tried hard .
<en=40>The gods were n't with us on that one .
