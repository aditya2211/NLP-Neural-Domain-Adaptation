<en=1>Remember Luis Posada Carriles ?
<en=2>Here 's a Miami Herald interview with the relaxed terrorist and former CIA operative in a luxury condo , published yesterday .
<en=3>( " At first I hid a lot .
<en=4>I thought the US government was looking for me .
<en=5>Now I hide a lot less . " )
<en=6>Because of such talk , Posada has been taken into custody by Immigration officials .
<en=7>I ca n't imagine they wanted to do this .
<en=8>Authorities would likely have been happy answering questions about Posada 's whereabouts with an indefinite shrug .
<en=9>As recently as last week the official line stated they had no knowledge he had entered the country .
<en=10>But comfortable among the thugs , Posada overplayed his hand and embarrassed his old patron , the US government .
<en=11>And though he 'd been a faithful servant , he was not such a player that he could get away with that .
<en=12>He should have taken a cue from another bomber some pesky dark - skinned foreigners want extradited , CIA operative Michael Meiring .
<en=13>Posada should have told any inquisitive journalist at his doorstep something like Meiring told the single American reporter who bothered following his bloody trail from the Philippines , that " If this harms me in any way , you will find my power then , and you 'll find out who I am . "
<en=14>But then , maybe that would n't have saved him either , because Posada is not Meiring .
<en=15>Posada can be given up , but Meiring ca n't .
<en=16>Meiring 's crimes are fresh , and wave the false flag which is the " War on Terror . "
<en=17>They happened in the Philippines which , like Pakistan , is an important and vulnerable node for the business which intelligence agencies and terrorist organizations conduct with each other .
<en=18>( Ask Terry Nichols about the Philippines . )
<en=19>The bombings implicated Muslims , and exacerbated regional tensions which the Bush regime and its friends wearing the brass in the Philippine military sought to exploit .
<en=20>Posada 's crimes , on the other hand , must seem like ancient history , especially to a people who do n't know their history .
<en=21>And to those who do n't even know their crimes , not even that .
<en=22>But will Posada be given up ?
<en=23>I doubt he will be extradited to Venezuela , which is the only way that question could be answered with a Yes .
<en=24>I expect it will be determined that , under " Strong Man " Hugo Chavez , Posada could not be guaranteed a fair trial .
<en=25>The hope may be that Posada can soon be offered to a post-Chavez Allawi - like puppet in Caracas .
<en=26>Whether such an offer were accepted or declined would make no difference ; justice would not be served then .
<en=27>But Posada 's nearly 80 years old , and the Venezuelan people will ensure that 's a vain hope .
<en=28>So instead Posada may be held indefinitely , in comfortable custody .
<en=29>An embarrassment to the US still , just not as embarrassing as having the old killer strut about Miami , gloating in his freedom .
<en=30>Meiring is more than an embarrassment .
<en=31>His case threatens the consensus fiction of the " War on Terror . "
<en=32>So his name will remain unspoken .
<en=33>Another connection to Philippine terror and weapons smuggling - dating from the 1980s - is alleged in the book Disposable Patriot , by Jack Terrell .
<en=34>Terrell , a CIA asset originally recruited for the Contra effort , identifies the man attempting to recruit him into the Philippine scheme as Oliver North ...
<en=35>I seem to recall the object was to smuggle explosives .
<en=36>http://www.amazon.ca/exec/obidos/ASIN/0915765381/701-3377456-8181939
<en=37>I 've read the book - it 's a first person memoir with the ring of truth , especially since so much of the wider context has confirmed the allegations of Contra drug connections that led to Terrell becoming a target for discrediting by the TWIG counterintelligence group that ran interference for the Contra effort , staffed by covert ops types including Ollie North , Robert Owen , Vince Cannistaro and Buck Revell .
<en=38>Peter Dale Scott includes an account of how Terrell 's whistleblowing was stifled by them in his book Cocaine Politics .
<en=39>... same ole , same ole ...
<en=40>Due to the Judge in the 1983 case ruling that a CIA agent could not testify using a pseudonym , therefore opening him to cross-examination by Wilson , the prosecution had a problem .
<en=41>They needed someone that could convince the jury they had been able to see all relevant documents in CIA files on Wilson .
<en=42>Wilson was claiming that he had been working for the CIA when he sold the C - 4 to Quaddaffi .
<en=43>The prosecution was charging he was a rogue using his contacts from former service in both CIA and the ' Office of Naval Intelligence ' .
<en=44>Wilson had been able to show that he 'd had more than 80 " non-social contacts " with the CIA since his retirement in 1971 , leaving the prosecution 's case in turmoil .
<en=45>Then Charles A. Briggs came to the rescue .
<en=46>Third ranking CIA officer , Briggs signed a declaration on February 3rd , 1983 , that on November 8th , 1982 , he had authorized a search of CIA records " for any material that in any way pertains to Edwin P. Wilson , or the various allegations concerning his activities after February 28th , 1971 , when he retired from the CIA . "
<en=47>The Briggs Declaration states that with one exception in 1972 , Wilson did not work " directly or indirectly " for the CIA since retiring .
<en=48>http://www.disinfo.com/archive/pages/dossier/id334/pg1/
<en=49>Last week , Federal District Judge Lynn Hughes in Huston , Texas , threw out Wilson 's two - decades old conviction .
<en=50>Judge Hughes wrote : ` government knowingly used false evidence against him , ' concluding ` honesty comes hard to government . '
