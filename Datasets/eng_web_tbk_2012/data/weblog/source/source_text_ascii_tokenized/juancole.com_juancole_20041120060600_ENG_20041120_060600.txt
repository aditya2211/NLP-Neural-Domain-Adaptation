<en=1>My opinion piece on the implications of Arafat 's passing for al - Qaeda has appeared at Newsday .
<en=2>Excerpt :
<en=3>" Arafat 's secular nationalism was supple enough to compromise with Israel and to imagine a two - state solution , even if the road of negotiations remained rocky .
<en=4>The continued Israeli colonization of the occupied Palestinian territories during the 1990s helped , along with terrorist attacks by radical groups such as Hamas , to derail the peace process , which Sharon had always opposed .
<en=5>Arafat 's death creates a vacuum in Palestinian leadership that will not soon be filled .
<en=6>Sharon 's assassination of major Hamas leaders has also weakened authority structures in that party .
<en=7>If the Israelis and the Palestinian leadership can not find a way to reinvigorate the peace process , cells of radical young Palestinians may grow up that look to bin Laden for their cues .
<en=8>Even if local Palestinian leaders remain strong enough to keep al - Qaida out , the festering Israeli - Palestinian struggle remains among the best recruiting posters for al - Qaida with young Muslim men .
<en=9>Resolving this conflict would be the most effective weapon the United States could deploy in its war on terror . "
