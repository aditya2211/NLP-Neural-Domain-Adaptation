<en=1>The debate that a handful of Texas multi-millionnaires close to the Bush family have cleverly manufactured over John Kerry 's war record is absurd in every way .
<en=2>The charges that they have put some vets up to making against Kerry are false and can be demonstrated by the historical record to be false .
<en=3>Most of those making the charges have even flip - flopped , contradicting themselves .
<en=4>Or they were n't eyewitnesses and are just lying .
<en=5>But to address the substance of this Big Lie is to risk falling into its logic .
<en=6>The true absurdity of the entire situation is easily appreciated when we consider that George W. Bush never showed any bravery at all at any point in his life .
<en=7>He has never lived in a war zone .
<en=8>If some of John Kerry 's wounds were superficial , Bush received no wounds .
<en=9>( And , a piece of shrapnel in the forearm that caused only a minor wound would have killed had it hit an eye and gone into the brain ; the shrapnel being in your body demonstrates you were in mortal danger and did n't absent yourself from it .
<en=10>That is the logic of the medal ) .
<en=11>Kerry saved a man 's life while under fire .
<en=12>Bush did no such thing .
<en=13>What was Bush doing with his youth ?
<en=14>He was drinking .
<en=15>He was drinking like a fish , every night , into the wee hours .
<en=16>For decades .
<en=17>He gave no service to anyone , risked nothing , and did not even slack off efficiently .
<en=18>The history of alcoholism and possibly other drug use is a key issue because it not only speaks to Bush 's character as an addictive personality , but may tell us something about his erratic and alarming actions as president .
<en=19>His explosive temper probably provoked the disastrous siege of Fallujah last spring , killing 600 Iraqis , most of them women and children , in revenge for the deaths of 4 civilian mercenaries , one of them a South African .
<en=20>( Newsweek reported that Bush commanded his cabinet , " Let heads roll ! " )
<en=21>That temper is only one problem .
<en=22>Bush has a sadistic streak .
<en=23>He clearly enjoyed , as governor , watching executions .
<en=24>His delight in killing people became a campaign issue in 2000 when he seemed , in one debate , to enjoy the prospect of executing wrong - doers a little too much .
<en=25>He has clearly gone on enjoying killing people on a large scale in Iraq .
<en=26>Drug abuse can affect the ability of the person to feel deep emotions like empathy .
<en=27>Two decades of pickling his nervous system in various highly toxic substances have left Bush damaged goods .
<en=28>Even for those who later abstain , " visual - spatial abilities , abstraction , problem solving , and short - term memory , are the slowest to recover . "
<en=29>That he managed to get on the wagon ( though with that pretzel incident , you wonder how firmly ) is laudable .
<en=30>But he suffers the severe effects of the aftermath , and we are all suffering along with him now , since he is the most powerful man in the world .
<en=31>We all know by now that Bush did not even do his full service with the Texas Air National Guard , absenting himself to work on the Alabama senate campaign of Winton " Red " Blount .
<en=32>Whether he was actually AWOL during this stint is unclear .
<en=33>But it is clear that not only did Bush slack off on his National Guard service , but he slacked off from his campaign work .
<en=34>This little - noted interview with Blount 's nephew Murph Archibald , which appeared on National Public Radio 's " All Things Considered on March 30 , 2004 , gives a devastating insight into what it was like to have to suffer through Bush in that period .
<en=35>" All Things Considered ( 8:00 PM ET ) - NPR March 30 , 2004 Tuesday
<en=36>This campaign season , there have been questions about whether George W. Bush fulfilled his obligations to the National Guard as a young lieutenant in the early 1970s .
<en=37>For weeks , reporters scoured Alabama in search of pilots or anyone who might have remembered seeing Mr. Bush at the time he was serving in the National Guard there .
<en=38>There is one place in Alabama where Mr. Bush was present nearly every day : the headquarters in Montgomery of US Senate candidate Winton " Red " Blount .
<en=39>President Bush has always said that working for Blount was the reason he transferred to the Alabama Air National Guard .
<en=40>NPR 's Wade Goodwyn has this report about Mr. Bush 's time on that campaign .
<en=41>WADE GOODWYN reporting :
<en=42>In 1972 , Baba Groom was a smart , funny young woman smack - dab in the middle of an exciting US Senate campaign .
<en=43>Groom was Republican Red Blount 's scheduler , and in that job , she was the hub in the campaign wheel .
<en=44>Ask her about the handsome young man from Texas , and she remembers him 32 years later like it was yesterday .
<en=45>Ms. BABA GROOM ( Former Campaign Worker ) :
<en=46>He would wear khaki trousers and some old jacket .
<en=47>He was always ready to go out on the road .
<en=48>On the phone , you could hear his accent .
<en=49>It was a Texas accent .
<en=50>But he just melded with everybody .
<en=51>GOODWYN : The candidate Mr. Bush was working for , Red Blount , had gotten rich in Alabama in the construction business .
<en=52>Prominent Southern Republicans were something of a rare breed in those days .
<en=53>Blount 's support of the party led him to be appointed Richard Nixon 's postmaster general .
<en=54>In Washington , Blount became friends and tennis partners with Mr. Bush 's father , then Congressman Bush .
<en=55>That was how 26 - year - old Lieutenant Bush came to Montgomery , at his father 's urging . . .
<en=56>It was Mr. Bush 's job to organize the Republican county chairpersons in the 67 Alabama counties .
<en=57>Back in 1972 in the Deep South , many rural counties did n't have much in the way of official Republican Party apparatus .
<en=58>But throughout Alabama , there were Republicans and Democrats who wanted to help Red Blount .
<en=59>It was the young Texan 's job to find out what each county leader needed in the way of campaign supplies and get those supplies to them .
<en=60>Groom says this job helped Mr. Bush understand how even in a statewide Senate campaign , politics are local .
<en=61>. . . Murph Archibald is Red Blount 's nephew by marriage , and in 1972 , he was coming off a 15 - month tour in Vietnam in the infantry .
<en=62>Archibald says that in a campaign full of dedicated workers , Mr. Bush was not one of them .
<en=63>Mr. MURPH ARCHIBALD ( Nephew of Red Blount ) : Well , I was coming in early in the morning and leaving in mid-evenings .
<en=64>Ordinarily , George would come in around noon ; he would ordinarily leave around 5:30 or 6:00 in the evening .
<en=65>GOODWYN : Archibald says that two months before the election , in September of '72 , Red Blount 's campaign manager came to him and asked that he quietly take over Mr. Bush 's job because the campaign materials were not getting out to the counties .
<en=66>Mr. ARCHIBALD : George certainly did n't seem to have any concerns about my taking over this work with the campaign workers there .
<en=67>My overall impression was that he did n't seem as interested in the campaign as the other people who were working at the state headquarters .
<en=68>GOODWYN : Murph Archibald says that at first , he did n't know that Mr. Bush was serving in the Air National Guard .
<en=69>After he found out from somebody else , Archibald attempted to talk to Mr. Bush about it .
<en=70>The president was a lieutenant and Archibald had been a lieutenant , too ; he figured they had something to talk about .
<en=71>Mr. ARCHIBALD : George did n't have any interest at all in talking about the military .
<en=72>In fact , when I broached the subject with him , he simply changed the subject .
<en=73>He was n't unpleasant about it , but he just changed the subject and would n't talk about it .
<en=74>GOODWYN : Far from Texas and Washington , DC , Mr. Bush enjoyed his freedom .
<en=75>He dated a beautiful young woman working on the campaign .
<en=76>He went out in the evenings and had a good time .
<en=77>In fact , he left the house he rented in such disrepair -- with damage to the walls and a chandelier destroyed -- that the Montgomery family who owned it still grumble about the unpaid repair bill .
<en=78>Archibald says Mr. Bush would come into the office and , in a friendly way , offer up stories about the drinking he 'd done the night before , kind of as a conversation starter .
<en=79>Mr. ARCHIBALD : People have different ways of starting the days in any office .
<en=80>They 're going to talk about their kids , they 're going to talk about football , they 're going to talk about the weather .
<en=81>And this was simply his opening gambit ; he would start talking about that he had been out late the night before drinking .
<en=82>GOODWYN : Archibald says the frequency with which Mr. Bush discussed the subject was off - putting to him .
<en=83>Mr. ARCHIBALD : I mean , at that time , I was 28 ; George would have been 25 or 26 .
<en=84>And I thought it was really unusual that someone in their mid-20s would initiate conversations , particularly in the context of something as serious as a US senatorial campaign , by talking about their drinking the night before .
<en=85>I thought it unusual and , frankly , inappropriate .
<en=86>GOODWYN : According to Archibald , Mr. Bush would also sometimes tell stories about his days at Yale in New Haven , and how whenever he got pulled over for erratic driving , he was let go after the officers discovered he was the grandson of a Connecticut US senator .
<en=87>Archibald , a middle - class Alabama boy -- who , by the way , is now a registered Democrat -- did n't like that story .
<en=88>Mr. ARCHIBALD : He told us whenever he was stopped , as soon as the law enforcement found out that he was the grandson of Prescott Bush , they would let him go .
<en=89>And he would always laugh about that . "
<en=90>Goodwyn dutifully notes that Baba Groom did n't remember George telling drunk stories .
<en=91>But that means nothing , since they were n't the sort of things guys like Bush told the " girls " .
<en=92>He was trying to buddy with Archibald and impress him .
<en=93>Again , decades of this sort of behavior do not leave a person untouched .
<en=94>Our world is in crisis and our Republic is in danger .
<en=95>It should not be left in the hands of a man who spent his life like this .
