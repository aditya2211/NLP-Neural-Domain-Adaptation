<en=1>There has been random speculation about Google developiong a new browser and / or acquiring Firefox .
<en=2>It is true that Google has been in acquisition mode .
<en=3>They have acquired Urchin , Zipdash , Applied Semantics , Picasa , Blogger , and satellite imaging company Keyhole , so why not Firefox ?
<en=4>I have no inside information , but I have been following links today that strongly indicate that Google is damn serious about securing permanent control of the leading edge browser technology in Firefox .
<en=5>Ben Goodger is the lead engineer for Mozilla Firefox .
<en=6>He announced this in January :
<en=7>As of January 10 , 2005 , my source of income changed from The Mozilla Foundation to Google , Inc. of Mountain View , California .
<en=8>My role with Firefox and the Mozilla project will remain largely unchanged , I will continue doing much the same work as I have described above - with the new goal of successful 1.1 , 1.5 and 2.0 releases .
<en=9>I remain devoted full - time to the advancement of Firefox , the Mozilla platform and web browsing in general .
<en=10>He also announced this in January :
<en=11>Welcome Darin !
<en=12>I just want to extend a big " Welcome ! " to Darin Darin Fisher who joined me at Google this week .
<en=13>2005 is going to rock !
<en=14>Darin Fisher wrote this response on January 25 , 2005 :
<en=15>Me and the big " G "
<en=16>Following on the heels of Ben 's annoucement yesterday , I thought I 'd post that I have joined Google as well .
<en=17>Like Ben , I will still be very much involved with the Mozilla project and community :-)

<en=19>Ben made another announcement on March 28 , 2005 :
<en=20>I want to use this opportunity to welcome Brian Ryner to Google !
<en=21>Brian has been one of the most crucial elements to the success of Mozilla software over the past few years , ...
<en=22>Great to have you on board !
<en=23>Now , none of this has been confirmed by Google at the present time , but it 's an old adage that you follow the money to see who is behind something .
<en=24>In this case , following the talent leads me to think that Google will be making an announcement this year that formalizes the Google - Mozilla / Firefox relationship .
<en=25>If you have not already seen the Flash movie Epic , you should take a few minutes and view the future history of media as conceived by Robin Sloan and Matt Thompson , with music by Aaron McLeran .
<en=26>In this movie Google and Amazon ( GOOGLEZON ) create a brave new world of media in 2008 .
<en=27>This is one thought - provoking film .
<en=28>Every move Google makes brings this particular future closer .
<en=29>Just one small commment - it 's not possible , as far as I know , for Google to " Aquire " Firefox .
<en=30>They already have rights to take it , alter it , and release those changes to the world - this is what the whole open source thing is about .
<en=31>I 'm inclined to say that google is doing what they can to both shape and support the growth of the most popular non-Microsoft browser out there - by taking on the leading lights in Firefox development , they 're ensuring the continued life of the project , and ensuring ( not that I think they need to ) that their voice will be heard admidst the higher echelons of the firefox development team .
<en=32>It 's this sort of enlightened self interest that keeps large open source projects alive .
<en=33>Fascinating viewpoint of the future in Epic .
<en=34>Thanks for the link .
<en=35>Malach , What you say makes sense .
<en=36>Acquiring open source talent gives a company an inexpensive way of influencing and anticipating the direction an open source project will go .
<en=37>It probably gives more bang for the buck than acquiring a private company and having to handle the inevitable culture clashes and process mis-matches .
