<en=1>Ok .
<en=2>We all know that John Kerry served in Vietnam .
<en=3>Four whole months , after which he took advantage of a little - known , little - invoked regulation that allowed him to desert his " band of brothers " .
<en=4>We also know how Dan Rather libeled George Bush and impugned his service in the Texas Air National Guard on a " 60 Minutes II " report based largely on forged documents .
<en=5>During his time in the Guard , George Bush flew the F - 102 Delta Dagger fighter - interceptor .
<en=6>The F - 102 saw service in the Vietnam theater between March 1962 and December 1969 .
<en=7>During this time , F - 102 squadrons were based out of Tan Son Nhut , Da Nang and Bien Hoa in Vietnam , and Udorn and Don Muang in Thailand .
<en=8>( Click here for source . )
<en=9>As far as George Bush knew , he and his unit could have been transferred to Vietnam .
<en=10>In all this so - called controversy , has anyone considered that perhaps George Bush just wanted to fly jets ?
<en=11>And , let 's remember , flying supersonic fighter jets is dangerous !
<en=12>They do n't let just anybody do it .
<en=13>Some reporters ( you know , the ones with journalistic ethics ) have actually uncovered the truth about George Bush 's service in the Texas Air National Guard .
<en=14>For example , did you know that George Bush spent considerably more time in uniform than John Kerry ?
<en=15>What follows is the text of an e-mail sent to me by a friend of mine ( thanks to Dave Manzano ) .
<en=16>Read on to learn the facts .
<en=17>---------
<en=18>Bush 's National Guard years
<en=19>Before you fall for Dems ' spin , here are the facts
<en=20>What do you really know about George W. Bush 's time in the Air National Guard ?
<en=21>That he did n't show up for duty in Alabama ?
<en=22>That he missed a physical ?
<en=23>That his daddy got him in ?
<en=24>News coverage of the president 's years in the Guard has tended to focus on one brief portion of that time - to the exclusion of virtually everything else .
<en=25>So just for the record , here , in full , is what Bush did :
<en=26>The future president joined the Guard in May 1968 .
<en=27>Almost immediately , he began an extended period of training .
<en=28>Six weeks of basic training .
<en=29>Fifty - three weeks of flight training .
<en=30>Twenty - one weeks of fighter - interceptor training .
<en=31>That was 80 weeks to begin with , and there were other training periods thrown in as well .
<en=32>It was full - time work .
<en=33>By the time it was over , Bush had served nearly two years .
<en=34>Not two years of weekends .
<en=35>Two years .
<en=36>After training , Bush kept flying , racking up hundreds of hours in F - 102 jets .
<en=37>As he did , he accumulated points toward his National Guard service requirements .
<en=38>At the time , guardsmen were required to accumulate a minimum of 50 points to meet their yearly obligation .
<en=39>According to records released earlier this year , Bush earned 253 points in his first year , May 1968 to May 1969 ( since he joined in May 1968 , his service thereafter was measured on a May - to - May basis ) .
<en=40>Bush earned 340 points in 1969 - 1970 .
<en=41>[ In other words , Bush earned enough points to satisfy the requirements for his entire six year hitch in 1969 - 1970 alone .
<en=42>- acd ]
<en=43>He earned 137 points in 1970 - 1971 .
<en=44>And he earned 112 points in 1971 - 1972 .
<en=45>The numbers indicate that in his first four years , Bush not only showed up , he showed up a lot .
<en=46>Did you know that ?
<en=47>That brings the story to May 1972 - the time that has been the focus of so many news reports - when Bush " deserted " ( according to anti-Bush filmmaker Michael Moore ) or went " AWOL " ( according to Terry McAuliffe , chairman of the Democratic National Committee ) .
<en=48>Bush asked for permission to go to Alabama to work on a Senate campaign .
<en=49>His superior officers said OK .
<en=50>Requests like that were n't unusual , says retired Col. William Campenni , who flew with Bush in 1970 and 1971 .
<en=51>" In 1972 , there was an enormous glut of pilots , " Campenni says .
<en=52>" The Vietnam War was winding down , and the Air Force was putting pilots in desk jobs .
<en=53>In '72 or '73 , if you were a pilot , active or Guard , and you had an obligation and wanted to get out , no problem .
<en=54>In fact , you were helping them solve their problem . "
<en=55>So Bush stopped flying .
<en=56>From May 1972 to May 1973 , he earned just 56 points - not much , but enough to meet his requirement .
<en=57>Then , in 1973 , as Bush made plans to leave the Guard and go to Harvard Business School , he again started showing up frequently .
<en=58>In June and July of 1973 , he accumulated 56 points , enough to meet the minimum requirement for the 1973 - 1974 year .
<en=59>Then , at his request , he was given permission to go .
<en=60>Bush received an honorable discharge after serving five years , four months and five days of his original six - year commitment .
<en=61>By that time , however , he had accumulated enough points in each year to cover six years of service .
<en=62>During his service , Bush received high marks as a pilot .
<en=63>A 1970 evaluation said Bush " clearly stands out as a top notch fighter interceptor pilot " and was " a natural leader whom his contemporaries look to for leadership . "
<en=64>A 1971 evaluation called Bush " an exceptionally fine young officer and pilot " who " continually flies intercept missions with the unit to increase his proficiency even further . "
<en=65>And a 1972 evaluation called Bush " an exceptional fighter interceptor pilot and officer . "
<en=66>Now , it is only natural that news reports questioning Bush 's service - in The Boston Globe and The New York Times , on CBS and in other outlets - would come out now .
<en=67>Democrats are spitting mad over attacks on John Kerry 's record by the group Swift Boat Veterans for Truth .
<en=68>And , as it is with Kerry , it 's reasonable to look at a candidate 's entire record , including his military service - or lack of it .
<en=69>Voters are perfectly able to decide whether it 's important or not in November .
<en=70>The Kerry camp blames Bush for the Swift boat veterans ' attack , but anyone who has spent much time talking to the Swifties gets the sense that they are doing it entirely for their own reasons .
<en=71>And it should be noted in passing that Kerry has personally questioned Bush 's service , while Bush has not personally questioned Kerry 's .
<en=72>In April - before the Swift boat veterans had said a word - Kerry said Bush " has yet to explain to America whether or not , and tell the truth , about whether he showed up for duty . "
<en=73>Earlier , Kerry said , " Just because you get an honorable discharge does not , in fact , answer that question . "
<en=74>Now , after the Swift boat episode , the spotlight has returned to Bush .
<en=75>That 's fine .
<en=76>We should know as much as we can .
<en=77>And perhaps someday Kerry will release more of his military records as well .
