<en=2>John Donovan from Argghhh! has put out a excellent slide show on what was actually found and fought for in Fallujah .
<en=3>Click here To view it .
<en=4>He makes some good observations on a few of the pic's .
<en=5>One of the pictures shows a flag that was found in Fallujah .
<en=6>On the next two pictures he took screenshots of two beheading video's .
