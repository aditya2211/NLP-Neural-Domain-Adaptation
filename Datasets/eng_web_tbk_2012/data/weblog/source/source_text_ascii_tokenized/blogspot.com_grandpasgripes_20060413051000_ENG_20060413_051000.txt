<en=1>Iran says it is creating nuclear energy without wanting nuclear weapons .
<en=2>The United States does n't believe the Iranian Government .
<en=3>One can suspect the Iranian Government .
<en=4>But there is no proof .
<en=5>I read an Article in Time magazine accusing the Iranian Government of being willing to start a nuclear war and I sympathise with the Article .
<en=6>They are certainly being nasty to the United Nations Security Council in connection with the anti-proliferation treaty .
<en=7>The President has also said he would like to see Israel wiped off the map which he could n't even begin to try without nuclear weapons .
<en=8>But he has insisted that he wants nuclear power for peaceful purposes .
<en=9>Many people want to use diplomacy with Iran rather than military pressure .
<en=10>But will diplomacy work ?
<en=11>And can anyone use military pressure without proof ?
<en=12>One reader pointed out that the President watched the Americans in the embassy when they took them hostage .
<en=13>He has denied this .
<en=14>We do n't have to believe him .
<en=15>But we ca n't prove it .
<en=16>It does seem that Iranians frequently make statements and then hide behind lack of proof .
