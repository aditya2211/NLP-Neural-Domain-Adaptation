<en=5>India defensive over Sri Lanka

<en=7>NEW DELHI -
<en=8>While India is ready to enter into a " defense cooperation agreement " with Sri Lanka , it is wary of being drawn into any military involvement in the island nation 's two decades - old civil war that has seen violent strife between ethnic Tamils and the Sinhalese majority - leaving over 60,000 dead on both sides .
<en=9>And that explains the delay in the signing of a formal defense agreement that was at the heart of Sri Lankan President Chandrika Kumaratunga 's four - day visit to India recently .
<en=10>According to Professor S D Muni , South Asia expert at the Jawaharal Nehru University , the two - year peace talks between Colombo and the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam ( LTTE ) are stalemated .
<en=11>For that reason , he said , Kumaratunga 's government was keen to beef up military preparedness with Indian support .
<en=12>" The Sri Lankan government does not want to initiate a conflict but would be interested in deterring the LTTE from starting one .
<en=13>And the Tigers look as if they are on the brink of launching another offensive , " Muni told IPS .
<en=14>Colombo held six rounds of talks with the Tigers between September 2002 and March 2003 .
<en=15>But last April , the rebels abruptly pulled out of negotiations demanding recognition , first , for the right to self - rule before proceeding any further .
<en=16>Kumaratunga 's India tour preceded a three - day visit to Sri Lanka by Norwegian Foreign Minister Jan Petersen in a new bid to revive the peace talks that were supposed to follow a ceasefire that Oslo successfully brokered in February 2002 .
<en=17>Petersen held discussions with both Kumaratunga and the reclusive LTTE leader Velupillai Prabhakaran in the rebel stronghold of Kilinochchi without success , and chief Tamil rebel negotiator Anton Balasingham and Norwegian envoy Erik Solheim held closed - door talks at the international airport late Saturday in an effort to keep the salvage effort on track , diplomatic sources said .
<en=18>But they , too , failed .
<en=19>Colombo , too , seems to be in an intractable position .
<en=20>According to former Indian army general A S Kalkat , the difficulty for Kumaratunga 's government lay in the fact that the LTTE had become a de jure power in the north and east of the island and was running every aspect of civil administration in the areas within its control .
<en=21>A veteran of India 's military intervention in the Jaffna peninsula to help implement the 1987 Indo - Sri Lanka Peace Accord - which ambitiously provided for the disarming of the formidable LTTE - Kalkat said the new defense deal would essentially be a reiteration of the older one minus its military commitment .
<en=22>Kalkat , who currently chairs the independent US - based International Council on Conflict Resolution , said despite the failure of the Indian army to disarm or even subdue the Tigers , India remained the only power capable of influencing the course of the current peace talks .
<en=23>" The Norwegians mean well but their role is limited to that of honest broker and the LTTE is keenly aware that they do not have the power [ unlike India ] to underwrite any arrangement , " Kalkat told IPS in an interview .
<en=24>In 1987 , the Tamil Tigers reluctantly accepted the peace accord under Indian pressure .
<en=25>Under the accord , a new northeastern provincial council was formed and the Indian army was deployed as peacekeepers in the north and east .
<en=26>However , differences between India and LTTE soon surfaced and led to clashes between Tiger guerrillas and the Indian peace keeping force .
<en=27>About 1,200 Indian soldiers were killed during this phase of the conflict .
<en=28>India had to pull back its forces from Sri Lanka in 1989 following the election of Ranasinghe Premadasa , a strong critic of Indian mediation .
<en=29>Last June , an international initiative led by Japan to persuade the LTTE to come back to the negotiating table failed despite an aid package offer of US$ 4.5 billion .
<en=30>Japan 's special envoy , Yasushi Akashi , who called for tangible progress in the peace process before the money would be released , came back from visits to Colombo and Kilinochchi in early November a frustrated man .
<en=31>He complained about the " visible lack of progress " and reaching an impasse in talks with both sides .
<en=32>The Tigers ' chief ideologue , Balasingham , sniffed at the proposal saying that " a solution to the ethnic conflict can not be predetermined by the resolutions or declarations of donor conferences , but has to be negotiated by the parties in conflict without the constraints of external forces . "
<en=33>But there are strong hints in the country that a new Indo - Sri Lanka defense deal could be in the making .
<en=34>And this has already drawn protests from the Tamil National Alliance ( TNA ) which was backed by the LTTE in the April general elections held in Sri Lanka .
<en=35>" Tamils feel that the proposed defense agreement between India and Sri Lanka would encourage Sinhala rulers to prepare for another war abandoning the current peace process , " TNA member of parliament P Sithamparanathan was quoted as saying in a statement .
<en=36>She added that recent visits to the island by India 's top military brass including army chief General Nirmal Chander Vij have " caused apprehension among Tamils that preparations are under way for another war in the island " .
<en=37>But Kalkat pointed out that India would be ill - advised to be involved again , militarily , with Sri Lanka if only because it still had to consider the sentiments of 45 million ethnic Tamils in the Indian state of Tamil Nadu - separated from Sri Lanka 's Jaffna peninsula by the narrow Palk Straits .
<en=38>Apart from the 1,200 Indian lives lost in 1987 , the Indian peacekeeping force was immensely unpopular not only in Tamil Nadu and the Jaffna peninsula but also among the Sinhalese majority who considered it a violation of their country 's sovereignty .
<en=39>The best option , now , under the present difficult circumstances is for Colombo to do its own dirty work , although New Delhi can always be counted on to render good neighborly help because of the shared belief that religion , ethnicity and language can not be the basis for secession .
<en=40>In any case , Kalkat puts it succinctly : " There can not be a military option to what is a political situation . "
