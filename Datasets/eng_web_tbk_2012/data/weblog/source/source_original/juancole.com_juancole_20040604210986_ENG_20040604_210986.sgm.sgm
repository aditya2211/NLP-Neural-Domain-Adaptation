As the American public gradually wearies of the Iraq crisis, some
have begun worrying that the war could blow back on the US by creating
the conditions for anti-American terrorism. Israel, however, is much
closer to Iraq and is likely to suffer from Iraqi instability much more
acutely than will the United States. Ironically, among the strongest
proponents of war in Iraq were Israeli Prime Minister Ariel Sharon and
his neoconservative supporters in the US. Have they, however, actually
weakened Israeli security?

The biggest threat Israel faces is not from conventional armies but
from the asymmetrical tactics of Palestinian national liberation
movements. The derailing of the Oslo peace process by the hard-line
policies of Sharon and the Palestinian intifada has encouraged suicide
bombings. This, in turn, has discouraged international investment in
Israel and has made it less likely that immigrants to the country will
actually remain there.

Although Israel withdrew from Lebanese territory in May 2000, the
radical Lebanese Shiite party, Hizbullah, has not been mollified. It is
estimated to have some 5,000 armed fighters, and they have pursued
attacks against Israeli forces to compel them to withdraw from the
Shebaa Farms, a sliver of Syrian territory that Israel annexed after the
1967 war.

Any thorough assessment of the impact of the Iraq war and its
aftermath on Israel's security environment must, therefore, closely
examine its likely effect on the conduct of asymmetrical warfare.
Although it is often alleged (without much evidence) that Saddam Hussein
gave money to the families of Palestinian suicide bombers and so
encouraged asymmetrical warfare, it is not clear that he actually posed
a danger to Israel. The Palestinians who have been willing to kill
themselves to end the Israeli occupation of the Gaza Strip and the West
Bank were not driven by economic considerations.

Saddam never did anything practical to help the Palestinians. At some
points, as in the late 1980s, he reportedly made behind-the-scenes
overtures to the Israelis to arrive at some sort of a deal. He did not
allow Palestinian radicals to launch operations against Israel from
Iraq. By the late 1990s, Iraq had no nuclear or biological weapons
program, and had destroyed its chemical weapons stockpiles. Its
ramshackle army had virtually collapsed before the American invasion in
2003.

If it is hard to see how Baathist Iraq posed any real threat to
Israel, it is not so difficult to see a menace in the current
instability. The bungling of post-war Iraq by the Bush administration
created a weak and failed state. Armed militias, many staffed by former
Iraqi military men with substantial training and experience, have
proliferated. The US chose to ally itself with such groups as the
Supreme Council for the Islamic Revolution in Iraq, whose 15,000-strong
Badr Corps paramilitary was trained by the Iranian Revolutionary Guards.

Anti-Israeli and pro-Palestinian feeling is strong among several
major Iraqi ideological groups and currents. The more radical Shiites,
who generally follow the theocratic notions of Iran's Ayatollah Ruhollah
Khomeini, routinely chant and demonstrate against Israel. They
vehemently protested the Israeli assassination of Sheikh Ahmed Yassin,
the leader of Hamas, last March. Worse for Israel, the assassination
drew a denunciation even from the moderate and cautious Grand Ayatollah
Ali Sistani, who wields enormous moral authority over Iraqi Shiites.

These Shiite movements had been suppressed by Saddam Hussein's
regime, but have now organized and armed themselves. They have also
reestablished their historical links with Lebanese and Iranian Shiites.
It is inevitable that most Iraqi Shiites will side with their Hizbullah
coreligionists against Israel, and it seems likely that Iraqi Shiites
will get rich enough from Iraqi petroleum sales in the future that they
will be in a good position to bankroll Lebanese Shiite radicals.

Sunni Arab fundamentalists deeply sympathize with the Palestinians
and with Hamas, and those in Iraq have deep historical inks with
fundamentalists in Jordan and Palestine. Iraqi cities such as Fallujah
and Ramadi were on the truck route from Amman to Baghdad, and so came
under the influence of the Salafi movement, which is popular in Jordan.
Secular Arab nationalist groups also universally sympathize with the
Palestinians, and those in post-Saddam Iraq are no exception.

Whereas Saddam Hussein's dictatorship ensured that such populist
currents were kept firmly under control, they are now free to organize.
An Iraq in which armed fundamentalist and nationalist militias
proliferate is inevitably a security worry for Israel. If even a modicum
of normality and security can be returned to Iraq, its citizens will be
able to benefit from the country's petroleum reserves. That private
wealth can easily be funneled into aid for the Palestinians and for
Lebanese Shiites.

Israel's security interests are best served by peace with its
neighbors, which can only be achieved by trading land for peace with the
Palestinians. Ariel Sharon's aggressive near annexation of almost half
of the occupied West Bank and his indefinite postponement of any
Palestinian state have created unprecedented rage and violence. The
anger has spread throughout the Muslim world, including Iraq. The
promotion by the pro-Zionist right of twin occupations - in the West
Bank and in Iraq - has profoundly weakened, not strengthened, Israeli
security.
