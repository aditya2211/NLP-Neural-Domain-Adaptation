The hottest item on Christmas wish lists this year is nuclear
weapons. Al-Qaeda wants them, Iran wants them, Russia wants the better
ones, and all the US wants is to give them all a piece of coal. For the
last few years there have been tensions with Iran’s nuclear program with
word coming this week that a deal was reached through the European Union
that meets with the approval of the International Atomic Energy Agency.
At the same time, an Iranian Opposition Group released what they call
proof of a covert nuclear weapons program. Arial photos, loose
connections to AQ Kahn and Libya make up the evidence that the group
presented. Russia also announced that it was seeking and building the
best nukes the world’s ever seen. President Vladimir Putin said Russia
is will have new nuclear weapons that other countries do not and will
not have.

With the demand so high, the question arises on to who should be or
has the right to be the Santa of nuclear weapons. Right now that seems
to be the US, EU, and IAEA. But not always do those three agree, and not
always are their decisions equal. The US has strongly opposed a nuclear
weapons program of Iran, yet Israel, which to this day has never
officially said that they posses nuclear weapons, ranks around fifth in
nuclear strength. It is estimated that Israel has over 200 nuclear
weapons yet neither the US nor any of her allies expresses the slightest
concern. North Korea’s Kim Jong Ill also has the bomb at the top of his
list and Santa seems to have already come a few years ago. It is rumored
that North Korea has at least a couple nuclear weapons.

But getting past who should get them, is who has them, and who is
really close. The case against Iran has a feeling of Déjà vu. Arial
photos of the lab were uranium is being enriched, somewhat like those of
chemical weapons stockpiles in Iraq. America cried wolf in Iraq, and
what’s scary is that sooner or later, that wolf will probably get us.
