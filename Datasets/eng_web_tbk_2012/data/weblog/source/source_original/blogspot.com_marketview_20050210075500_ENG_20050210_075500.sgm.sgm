Google has finally had an analyst day -- a chance to present the
company's story to the (miniscule number of) people who haven't heard
it. Usually, these are just a chance for the suckups to suck up, but
this time people are actually concerned about the company's plans. They
work on Wall Street, after all, so when they hear a company who's stated
goals include "Don't be evil," they imagine a company who's eventually
history will be "Don't be profitable." It's not quite as freewheeling an
environment as you'd imagine: Sergey Brin has actually created a
mathematical 'proof' that the company's self-driven research strategy,
which gives employees one day a week to do research projects on their
own, is a good, respectable idea . Read the entire article; there's a
punchline, too.
