The Iraqi Islamic Party lead by Muhsin Abdul Hamid, has been among
the few Sunni Muslim groups willing to cooperate (even if rather
lukewarmly) with the Americans. It is now threatening to pull out of the
Allawi caretaker government. The IIP had also been the main force urging
Sunni Arabs to participate in the elections scheduled for January, and
had been opposed in this stance by the Association of Muslim Scholars.
That the Iraqi Islamic Party is now contemplating leaving the Allawi
government raises the question of whether a mass Sunni Arab boycott of
the elections is in the offing, thus fatally weakening the legitimacy of
any new government.

Az-Zaman : The Association of Muslim Scholars forbade Iraqis to
participate in the attack on Fallujah with the Americans. In a
communique, the AMS said that for Iraqis to take part with "raiding
forces" in the assault on a city, the population of which is Muslim
(such as Fallujah) would be considered the most mortal of mortal sins.
The Sunni AMS told Iraqis, "You sinned when you participated with
occupation forces in the assault on Najaf, and beware lest you repeat
this same sin in Fallujah. Remember that the Occupation is emphemeral."

The radical Shiite Sadr movement issued a statement forbidding the
participation of Iraqi troops in the attack on Fallujah, as well. The
statement said, "We direct an appeal at the men in the Iraqi forces,
whether national guards or others, the majority of whom are Muslim,
calling upon them to refrain for commiting this enormous sin under the
banner of forces that do not respect our religion or any principles of
basic humanity, and we ask them to view this war as illegal." It called
a "ploy" the assertaion that the attack was merely on foreign fighters
at Fallujah.

The convergence of views among the more militant Sunni Muslim clerics
of AMS and the radical Shiites of the Sadr movement has been seen
before, last spring during the initial US assault on Fallujah and during
the US attack on Mahdi Army militiamen in Najaf. Most Shiites, however,
are still reluctant to take major risks to support the Sunnis of
Fallujah, many of whom had supported Saddam and his anti-Shiite pogroms.
