On the internet site of Monotheism and Holy War (al-Tawhid wa
al-Jihad) , the group allegedly declared, "We announce that the Tawhid
and Jihad Group, its prince and soldiers, have pledged allegiance to the
sheikh of the mujahideen Osama bin Laden." This pledge is a new
development. Abu Musab al-Zarqawi and his group are said to have been
bitter rivals of al-Qaeda during the Afghan resistance days. One witness
at the Moutasaddiq trial in Germany alleged that Zarqawi had not allowed
Monotheism and Holy War to share resources with al-Qaeda in the early
zeroes of the 21st century. If the statement is true, it is a worrying
sign that even the divided small radical guerrilla groups are being
"picked up" by al-Qaeda. This consolidation is obviously a result of
Bush's aggressive invasion of Iraq and of the botching of the aftermath.
It is a setback for the war on terror.

Al-Qaeda in Afghanistan was a group of only a few hundred "Afghan
Arabs" who pledged personal loyalty to Usamah Bin Laden. It could
notionally be expanded to encompass the 5,000-strong "55th Brigade" of
the Taliban regime, though this is not the technical definition. Because
Usamah is Saudi, my guess is that they were especially influenced by an
extremist form of the Wahhabi school of Islam that predominates among
Saudia's some 15 million citizens. In 1998 they were joined by Egyptians
from the al-Jihad al-Islami group of Ayman al-Zawahiri (many of these
were from Upper Egypt, especially Asyut and environs). After that point,
al-Qaeda was a joint enterprise between the Egyptian extremists and the
polyglot Arabs around Bin Laden, only some of whom were Saudi.

Zarqawi is a Jordanian, and his Monotheism and Holy War group in
Afghanistan probably had a distinctive coloration as mainly Jordanian,
Palestinian and Syrian. They also had a special connection to some
extremists in Jordan and Germany. They are probably especially oriented
toward the Salafi school of modern Islamic thought, which has a
Protestant-like emphasis on going back to the original practice of the
early companions of the Prophet Muhammad. (Most Salafis are not militant
or violent, though they tend to be rather narrow-minded in my
experience, on the order of Protestant Pietists). Monotheism and Holy
War obviously does have a violent interpretation of Salafism, rather as
the the leaders of the so-called German Peasant Rebellion among early
Protestants did.

Another worrisome sign is that local Iraqi Sunni fundamentalists
opposed to the US presence in Iraq have begun joining Monotheism and
Holy War, and wearing its distinctive orange and black insignia. These
have been sighted among Iraqi crowds on Haifa Street in Baghdad and in
Samarra. So now there are hundreds of al-Qaeda members in Iraq where
there had been none before.

The consolidation of smaller local radical fundamentalist groups with
al-Qaeda can also be seen in the case of the Fizazi group in Tangiers
that morphed into the Moroccan Islamic Combatant Group , had members who
met with September 11 ringleader Muhammad Atta, and ultimately was in
part responsible for the Madrid train bombings.
