The sheikh in wheel-chair has been attacked with a F-16-launched
bomb.

He could be killed years ago and the israelians have all the reasons,
since he founded and he is the spiritual leader of Hamas, but they
didn&amp;apost. Today&amp;aposs incident proves that Sharon has lost his
patience and his hope in peace. Nervous people make mistakes, so I
suppose there will be a wave of succesfull arab attacks. A la guerre
c&amp;aposest comme a la guerre!
