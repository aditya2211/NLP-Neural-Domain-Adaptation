Iran says it is creating nuclear energy without wanting nuclear
weapons. The United States doesn't believe the Iranian Government. One
can suspect the Iranian Government. But there is no proof . I read an
Article in Time magazine accusing the Iranian Government of being
willing to start a nuclear war and I sympathise with the Article. They
are certainly being nasty to the United Nations Security Council in
connection with the anti-proliferation treaty.

The President has also said he would like to see Israel wiped off the
map which he couldn't even begin to try without nuclear weapons. But he
has insisted that he wants nuclear power for peaceful purposes.

Many people want to use diplomacy with Iran rather than military
pressure. But will diplomacy work? And can anyone use military pressure
without proof?

One reader pointed out that the President watched the Americans in
the embassy when they took them hostage. He has denied this. We don't
have to believe him. But we can't prove it. It does seem that Iranians
frequently make statements and then hide behind lack of proof.
