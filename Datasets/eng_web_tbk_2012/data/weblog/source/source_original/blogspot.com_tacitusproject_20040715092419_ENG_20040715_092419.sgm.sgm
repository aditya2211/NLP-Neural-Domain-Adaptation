Important news such as President Bush's miniscule calibrations on his
marriage amendment/anti-gay (update: he's not against gays in the
bedroom, just at the altar, where of course their relationships should
not only be frowned upon but should be constitutionally excluded) has
pushed Sudan not just off the front pages, or the A section, but out of
the NY Times and Washington Post completely. I had to go to the BBC for
this report . It's symptomatic, I suppose, of our fast-paced, 24 hour
news-cycle lives, that the biggest short-term humanitarian crisis in the
world would quickly be eclipsed, once our Secretary of State was
finished with his whirlwind tour, from the newspapers. It's just
disappointing. Most troubling, however, is the fact that the political
will to end the crisis expressed a few short weeks ago seems to have
ebbed. At that time, UN Secretary General Kofi Annan demanded steps be
taken to end the ethnic violence in Darfur within 48 hours. Two weeks
later, and the violence continues. The African Union is clearly not up
to the task of keeping the peace, pledging 300 troops to an area that
will need 15,000, according to analysts. And international donors have
given only half of the relief aid that Darfur needs, according to the
local UN officials. So hear we are, two weeks later, after that dazzling
PR display two weeks ago by Powell and Annan, and the situation on the
ground in Darfur appears basically unchanged.
