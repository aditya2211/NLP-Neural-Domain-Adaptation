Trouble on India's islands

Ramtanu Maitra

In early February, India charged 34 Arakan separatists from Myanmar
with hiding in the Landfall Islands, part of the Andaman Islands group
(see end note). These alleged members of the Arakan Army, the military
wing of the National Unity Party in Myanmar, have been charged with
illegal entry. It is likely, but not certain, that they will be deported
to Myanmar.

But the news of the Arakan rebels is just the tip of the iceberg when
it comes to growing concern in New Delhi over the security of the
Andaman Islands. Reports are circulating in the intelligence community
that the Andaman Islands are not only thick with Myanmar rebels. It has
also become an arms depot of the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam
(LTTE), who operate almost freely in the Andaman Sea. Information
pointing in this direction came to light after the December 26 tsunami,
which took a heavy toll on the Andamans. Correspondents who flocked in
to cover the tsunami found they also had another story - the miserable
security situation surrounding the Indian navy's Far Eastern Naval
Command, now being established along with India's "blue water navy".

Deteriorating security

Security problems in the Andaman Sea are not new, but they have
deteriorated during the past few years, in tandem with a deterioration
in the security situation in Bangladesh, Nepal and Bhutan, and
particularly in the northeastern Indian states of Manipur, Nagaland and
Tripura. While the Indian army has become rock-solid in the western
front, and has developed the capability of withstanding any Pakistani
adventure in that sector, it has become highly vulnerable in its eastern
sector, where its enemy is not a national army but a multitude of
secessionist, terrorist and drug-running militants operating between
Southeast Asia and northeastern India through Bangladesh.

The Andaman Sea is a major conduit for this traffic, and the 572
large and small islands that constitute the Andaman and Nicobar group
are a natural transit base. The drugs and arms travel in all directions.
Since the "Sea Tigers" of the LTTE, better known as the Tamil Tigers,
are the ones who rule the Andaman Sea: they carry the arms and drugs for
their own use and also to deliver to rebels in Aceh and all along the
east coast of Africa. It is old news that the Tamil Tigers have
developed a strong network within South Africa.

This is not unknown to New Delhi. A recent report by a journalist
from Port Blair, in the Andamans, quoted an unnamed official saying that
foreigners from Myanmar, Bangladesh and Sri Lanka have permanently
settled in the islands, using fake Indian ration cards, while citizens
of Thailand, China, Indonesia and Malaysia have migrated temporarily to
plunder the natural resources and leave. "Port Blair, Havelock Islands,
Diglipur, Middle Nicobar, Campbell's Bay, Neil Islands and Rangott are
mostly overrun by foreigners," he said.

An official estimate issued in 2003 suggests there are 50,000
"foreigners" in the Andaman Islands, but unofficial figures are much
higher than this. A large number of them are Bangladeshis, who like
millions of their countrymen have left their densely populated homeland
to settle elsewhere. As most of them have few technical skills, and the
Andamans have little demand for them in any case, they turn to smuggling
and other unlawful activities. The presence of the Sea Tigers in the
area with guns, cash and drugs makes the situation extremely dangerous.

Reports from Port Blair make it evident that New Delhi gets little
on-the-ground intelligence, and the Indian Coast Guard is grossly
unequipped to deal with the surge of illegal migrants to the islands.
One unnamed naval officer was quoted saying, "Arms smuggling is a very
profitable business in this region." Considering the islands' huge
strategic importance, it is amazing how lax New Delhi has been. These
islands sit aside the vital sea lanes of the Strait of Malacca, through
which 300 tankers and merchant ships pass daily, bringing in oil for the
Far East and Southeast Asia.

Intelligence lapses

As the implications of the Andaman Islands situation sink in, Indian
intelligence has inevitably come under scrutiny. In recent months, its
fallibility has become evident. The inability to foresee in advance the
assassination attempt on the pro-India political leader and former
Bangladeshi prime minister Sheikh Hasina Wazed last August 21 at a
political rally in Dhaka, and the recent "coup" by Nepalese King
Gyanendra dismissing his government and imposing a virtual absolute
monarchy, are glaring examples of intelligence failure.

With growing economic and military power, India will be dependent on
smaller nations in the region increasingly to maintain regional
security. Unless New Delhi does better in providing security to its own
nationals against rebels, secessionists, drug runners and arms
traffickers, it will not generate much confidence in the capitals of
surrounding nations. In fact, it would tend to encourage more organized
anti-India outfits, such as the Pakistani Inter-Services Intelligence
(ISI) and outside-linked Maoists, to exploit these networks and weaken
India's eastern flank.

Indian intelligence's lackluster performance in dealing with the LTTE
is startling. This formidable enemy, which gave the Indian army a black
eye in the mid-1980s, has been operating in northeastern India and in
the Andaman Sea for a long time. In 2001, according to Indian army
officials, security forces launched a wide-ranging operation in the
300-some inhabited islands neighboring Andaman and Nicobar, and found
huge caches of arms. The arms were said to belong to the LTTE and "other
terrorist groups". The search-and-destroy operation was carried out by
the Indian government after repeated requests from Colombo.

In addition, LTTE activity in the Andaman Sea is well known to local
observers. The biggest LTTE maritime disaster was reported in the
now-defunct Asiaweek in 2001. A shipment of weapons, ammunition and
explosives, believed to have been purchased from Cambodia and worth
several million dollars, left the port of Phuket in Thailand in early
February 2001 aboard the freighter Comex-Joux 3. As is LTTE standard
procedure, the vessel changed its name at sea to Horizon. On its journey
across the Bay of Bengal the freighter was tracked by the Indian navy
and Orissa-based spy planes of India's Aviation Research Center; it was
intercepted by Indian naval vessels off Sri Lanka's east coast.

LTTE arms-running

In 1997, the Thai navy reported the interception of a 16-meter boat
after a chase off the Thai port of Ranong, and the confiscation of two
tons of weapons and ammunition. Among the weapons intercepted were two
rocket-propelled-grenade launchers, 20 assault rifles, M-79 grenade
launchers and more than 10,000 rounds of ammunition. Four persons were
arrested, reportedly belonging to the Manipur Revolutionary People's
Front. Six crew members were from the Arakan region of Myanmar. The boat
was heading toward Cox's Bazar in Bangladesh.

Until 1995 the LTTE maintained a base at Twante, an island off the
coat of Myanmar, west of the Andaman islands. Subsequently, Phuket
became the LTTE's main backup base. A Sri Lanka-born Tamil with a
Norwegian passport was arrested by Thai authorities in 2000 for his
links with the LTTE. At the time of his arrest, the suspect was
allegedly involved in constructing a "submarine" in a shipyard on the
island of Sirae near Phuket on the Andaman Sea coast.

Steady buildup

The real threat to the Andaman Islands is the steady building-up of
ports and conduits that serve the Tamil Tigers and a host of less-strong
militant groups. Over the past decade, Bangladesh has steadily moved
into a state of lawlessness. A number of extremist groups, under the
cover of the Islamist movement, have become active in drug trafficking,
gun running and anti-Indian activities.

It is widely acknowledged that the Pakistani ISI has nurtured a
number of extremist Islamist groups, such as the
Harkat-ul-Jehad-al-Islami, in the port city of Chittagong, and put a
number of secessionist rebels from India's northeast in touch with this
terrorist network.

As a result, north of the Andaman Islands, Bangladeshi coastal areas
have become a nest of terrorists involved in the shipment of drugs and
arms. A pattern of arrests and seizures indicate that arms are brought
by the LTTE from Laos, Cambodia and Thailand into Chittagong, from where
they are transported northward by land to Bhutan. The route from
Kalikhola in Bhutan to Cox's Bazar passes through northern Bengal, Assam
and Meghalaya, and on into Chittagong.

Note

India's Andaman and Nicobar Islands comprise more than 500 islands
lying 1,000 kilometers east of Sri Lanka in the Bay of Bengal.
Stretching 750 kilometers from end to end, they reach from near the
coast of Myanmar almost to Sumatra in Indonesia. The Ten Degree Channel
divides the Andamans, which are the larger and more heavily populated
northern islands, from the 20 or so Nicobar Islands in the south. On
South Andaman, the most heavily populated island, is Port Blair, which
is the capital and the only large town in the entire archipelago. Travel
to the Nicobar Islands is forbidden to non-Indians, and they are also
not allowed in some parts of South Andaman Island.
