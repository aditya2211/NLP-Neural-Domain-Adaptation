Karzai, Musharraf new regional equations

KABUL: For the past 25 years landlocked Afghanistan has suffered from
constant interference from its neighbours - Pakistan, Iran and the
Central Asian Republics - and regional powers -Russia and India. The
neighbours are still interfering, but there are signs that rather than
undermining Afghanistan’s stability they may now be trying to strengthen
it.

“The elections should be a reassurance to all our neighbours that a
stable Afghanistan, a peaceful Afghanistan is good for all. Nobody
should feel a looser in Afghanistan,’’ President Hamid Karzai told
Pakistan’s English daily The Nation.

All the regional countries have publicly backed the Karzai government
and supported the electoral process, but serious undercurrents remain as
they all have their favourite contenders in Afghanistan.

Since September 11, Pakistan has been repeatedly accused by Afghan
and Western leaders of harbouring Taliban extremists who had pledged to
disrupt the elections, but at the highest level the US has avoided
criticising President Pervaiz Musharraf on the grounds that he is
helping the US catch Al Qaeda elements inside Pakistan. That changed on
September 22 when President George W. Bush, Musharraf and Karzai held a
three way meeting in New York on the sidelines of the UN General
Assembly. The meeting was pushed together by the CIA and the US Defence
Department who were desperately anxious to secure a peaceful election in
Afghanistan and the non-interference of alleged Pakistani backed
Taliban.

Western and Afghan diplomats intimately involved with the meeting,
said Bush pushed Musharraf hard on reigning in the Taliban so the
elections could take place peacefully. ‘’Where are Mullah Omar, Mullah
Usmani and Gulbuddin Hikmetar?’’ Bush is reported to have asked a
flustered Musharraf. All three are extremist Taliban or their allies and
known to be living in Pakistan. (Mullah Omar is leader of the Taliban,
Usmani is the former corps commander of Kandahar under the Taliban
regime and now a commander of Taliban forces while Hikmetyar heads the
extremist Hizb-e-Islami.)

‘’It was the first time that Bush totally focused on the Taliban
threat rather than Al Qaeda with the Pakistanis,’’ says a Western
diplomat. ‘’Bush was very well briefed before the meeting,’’ the
diplomat said. An Afghan official at the meeting added, ‘’The Americans
now realise that the Taliban are a bigger threat to our security than Al
Qaeda.’’ Karzai was clearly pleased at the results. ‘’President
Musharraf promised to help us and cooperate with us on curbing terrorist
activity by the Taliban,’’ says Karzai.

The next day an angry Musharraf categorically said that Pakistan
would not send Pakistani troops to Iraq, a clear snub to the Americans.
Until then he had said Pakistan’s options were open. However Pakistani
officials insist that the decision was unconnected to the tripartite
meeting.

US and NATO military officers in Kabul say it is too early to say
whether Bush’s tough message was instrumental in persuading Musharraf
and the ISI to pressure the Taliban to restrain from disrupting the
elections. However there were visible signs of a crackdown on the
Pakistan side. ‘’Pakistan now has a large force deployed in Baluchistan
which was not there before,’’ says Lt. General David Barno. ‘’There is
much better tactical cooperation between our forces on both sides of the
border, but the movement of Taliban still goes on both ways,’’ he adds.
Also several days before the elections Pakistan closed the border
crossing point at Chaman in Baluchistan which is a key entry point for
the Taliban into Afghanistan.

However US military officers say regular army officers - many of them
Pashtun - leading units of the Frontier Corps who are on the border
remain deeply sympathetic to the Taliban and the mullahs of the JUI. At
the same time the US remains oblivious of the serious problems and
political fallout which the army is facing in its operations in
Waziristan. Not only is the army facing serious political fallout,
growing anti-Americanism and anti-army feeling in the tribal areas but
it is also taking heavy casualties -between 400-500 Pakistani soldiers
have been killed in the region since March.

Musharraf has always maintained that the US has never provided
actionable intelligence about Taliban leaders hiding in Baluchistan.
That too may change. US and Afghan intelligence will shortly be
presenting the ISI with a list of Taliban extremists and their suspected
whereabouts. Moreover there are now major covert attempts under way to
try and bring back to Kabul leading Taliban commanders, who have been
living quietly in Pakistan and have taken no part in the Taliban
insurgency.

With the Taliban failure to disrupt the Afghan elections, the
militants are even more isolated from the mainstream Taliban who want to
return home. Until now Pakistan has not facilitated such a return and
clearly it cannot happen until there is both a pull from Kabul and a
push from Islamabad. With President Karzai certain to win the elections
and the demotion of key former Northern Alliance figures such as General
Fahim and warlord Ismail Khan, there is now little reason for moderate
Taliban leaders to fear reprisals from former Northern Alliance figures
if they return home. Their removal should also provide increased
motivation for Pakistan to help the return of moderate Taliban.

Afghan officials welcomed the appointment on October 3 of Lt. General
Ashfaq Kiyani as the new ISI chief. Kayani is well known and liked in
Kabul as during the last year he led the Pakistani delegation in the
tripartite military meetings with the Afghan and US military on issues
related to border issues.

Karzai also has to deal with the stepped up rivalry between India and
Pakistan in Afghanistan. Islamabad accuses New Delhi of using its
consulates in Kandahar and Jalalabad to train Balochi insurgents who are
active in Pakistani Balochistan. Pakistani officials claim there are as
many as 42 RAW agents based in Kandahar and another 12 in Jalalabad.

“There have no business being there unless they are undermining
Pakistan,’’ says a Pakistani official. Both India and Afghanistan deny
the claim. ‘’Should Pakistan show us any evidence of an Indian hand
using Afghan soil to work against our neighbours we will take it very
seriously,” says Amrullah Saleh the head of Afghanistan’s National
Security Directorate.

Karzai categorically said that he has assured Musharraf repeatedly
that any adverse action against Pakistan taken by Indian diplomats
inside Afghanistan would be acted upon swiftly. Senior US diplomats and
military officials have warned India also.

In a major regional shift reflecting the newly strengthened position
of Karzai, Iran, Russia and India which have traditionally backed the
Tajik dominated former Northern Alliance made strenuous efforts to
convince presidential candidate Younis Qanooni to strike a deal with
Karzai before the elections and not to oppose Karzai. Iran in particular
feared that Qanooni would loose and then be politically isolated from
the mainstream. Qanooni refused to accept the Iranian advice as his
fellow Panjsheri Tajiks urged him to stand against Karzai. However since
the elections Iranian influence has proved critical in convincing the
Hazara Shia candidate Mohammed Mohaqeq to accept the results of the
elections and later convincing Qanooni to do the same.

With the US military presence posing a threat on their borders in
both Iraq and Afghanistan, Iran’s moderate leadership is keen to help
stabilise Karzai so that the US presence in Afghanistan is reduced.
However powerful hardliners in Tehran may be trying to undermine that
strategy and a new issue is likely to deepen the rift with the
moderates. Iranian officials are deeply concerned about the US
occupation of Shindand, a massive Soviet-era airbase just 30 kilometres
from Iran’s border. The enhanced US presence in western Afghanistan was
only made possible after the ousting of Ismail Khan, the warlord and
Governor of Herat province last month, who was a close ally of Iranian
hardliners. Iranian officials say they made no objections to Khan’s
ouster because they want to strengthen Karzai’s campaign against
warlords.

At a time of heightened tensions between Tehran and Washington over
Iran’s nuclear weapons program and calls by neo-conservatives in
Washington that a second Bush term should deal with Iran aggressively,
the Iranians fear that Shindand could be used as a listening post,
spying facility and even a launching pad for any future US actions
against Iran. Afghan officials say the Americans have moved over 100
Special Forces and helicopters to Shindand. However General Barno
insists the US presence poses no threat to Iran. ‘’We have a very small
number of forces in Shindand with a few helicopters,’’ says Barno.

Nevertheless this places Karzai in a difficult and sensitive
situation because he has to maintain excellent relations with both the
US and Iran. ‘’Afghanistan has had the benefit of cooperation from both
the US and Iran. So far what they have done together has been good for
us and that’s how we would like to keep it’’, says Karzai. Nobody can
claim that the interference of Afghanistan’s neighbours is over, but the
elections will do much to strengthen Karzai and deal more firmly with
neighbours’ interference. In the post election scenario it is becoming
abundantly clear that the Taliban do not have the support of the Afghan
people nor the Afghan Pashtuns.

In a highly significant move Afghan Pashtun tribes along the Pakistan
border warned the Taliban in Quetta and Chaman that if they try and
disrupt the elections, they would be resisted. Many Taliban living in
Afghanistan voted for President Karzai. It is now abundantly clear that
with the rapidly changing face of Afghanistan, the demise of key
Northern Alliance figures and the fluid political situation in
Afghanistan, Pakistan should reconsider its policy of giving unlimited
sanctuary to Taliban extremists living on Pakistani soil.
