Ok. We all know that John Kerry served in Vietnam. Four whole months,
after which he took advantage of a little-known, little-invoked
regulation that allowed him to desert his "band of brothers".

We also know how Dan Rather libeled George Bush and impugned his
service in the Texas Air National Guard on a "60 Minutes II" report
based largely on forged documents.

During his time in the Guard, George Bush flew the F-102 Delta Dagger
fighter-interceptor. The F-102 saw service in the Vietnam theater
between March 1962 and December 1969. During this time, F-102 squadrons
were based out of Tan Son Nhut, Da Nang and Bien Hoa in Vietnam, and
Udorn and Don Muang in Thailand. ( Click here for source. )

As far as George Bush knew, he and his unit could have been
transferred to Vietnam.

In all this so-called controversy, has anyone considered that perhaps
George Bush just wanted to fly jets? And, let's remember, flying
supersonic fighter jets is dangerous! They don't let just anybody do it.

Some reporters (you know, the ones with journalistic ethics) have
actually uncovered the truth about George Bush's service in the Texas
Air National Guard. For example, did you know that George Bush spent
considerably more time in uniform than John Kerry?

What follows is the text of an e-mail sent to me by a friend of mine
(thanks to Dave Manzano). Read on to learn the facts.

Bush’s National Guard years

Before you fall for Dems’ spin, here are the facts

What do you really know about George W. Bush’s time in the Air
National Guard? That he didn’t show up for duty in Alabama? That he
missed a physical? That his daddy got him in?

News coverage of the president’s years in the Guard has tended to
focus on one brief portion of that time — to the exclusion of virtually
everything else. So just for the record, here, in full, is what Bush
did:

The future president joined the Guard in May 1968. Almost
immediately, he began an extended period of training. Six weeks of basic
training. Fifty-three weeks of flight training. Twenty-one weeks of
fighter-interceptor training. That was 80 weeks to begin with, and there
were other training periods thrown in as well.

It was full-time work. By the time it was over, Bush had served
nearly two years. Not two years of weekends. Two years.

After training, Bush kept flying, racking up hundreds of hours in
F-102 jets. As he did, he accumulated points toward his National Guard
service requirements. At the time, guardsmen were required to accumulate
a minimum of 50 points to meet their yearly obligation.

According to records released earlier this year, Bush earned 253
points in his first year, May 1968 to May 1969 (since he joined in May
1968, his service thereafter was measured on a May-to-May basis). Bush
earned 340 points in 1969-1970. [In other words, Bush earned enough
points to satisfy the requirements for his entire six year hitch in
1969-1970 alone. - acd] He earned 137 points in 1970-1971. And he earned
112 points in 1971-1972.

The numbers indicate that in his first four years, Bush not only
showed up, he showed up a lot. Did you know that?

That brings the story to May 1972 — the time that has been the focus
of so many news reports — when Bush “deserted” (according to anti-Bush
filmmaker Michael Moore) or went “AWOL” (according to Terry McAuliffe,
chairman of the Democratic National Committee). Bush asked for
permission to go to Alabama to work on a Senate campaign. His superior
officers said OK.

Requests like that weren’t unusual, says retired Col. William
Campenni, who flew with Bush in 1970 and 1971.

“In 1972, there was an enormous glut of pilots,” Campenni says. “The
Vietnam War was winding down, and the Air Force was putting pilots in
desk jobs. In ’72 or ’73, if you were a pilot, active or Guard, and you
had an obligation and wanted to get out, no problem. In fact, you were
helping them solve their problem.”

So Bush stopped flying. From May 1972 to May 1973, he earned just 56
points — not much, but enough to meet his requirement.

Then, in 1973, as Bush made plans to leave the Guard and go to
Harvard Business School, he again started showing up frequently. In June
and July of 1973, he accumulated 56 points, enough to meet the minimum
requirement for the 1973-1974 year.

Then, at his request, he was given permission to go. Bush received an
honorable discharge after serving five years, four months and five days
of his original six-year commitment. By that time, however, he had
accumulated enough points in each year to cover six years of service.

During his service, Bush received high marks as a pilot. A 1970
evaluation said Bush “clearly stands out as a top notch fighter
interceptor pilot” and was “a natural leader whom his contemporaries
look to for leadership.” A 1971 evaluation called Bush “an exceptionally
fine young officer and pilot” who “continually flies intercept missions
with the unit to increase his proficiency even further.” And a 1972
evaluation called Bush “an exceptional fighter interceptor pilot and
officer.”

Now, it is only natural that news reports questioning Bush’s service
— in The Boston Globe and The New York Times, on CBS and in other
outlets — would come out now. Democrats are spitting mad over attacks on
John Kerry’s record by the group Swift Boat Veterans for Truth. And, as
it is with Kerry, it’s reasonable to look at a candidate’s entire
record, including his military service — or lack of it. Voters are
perfectly able to decide whether it’s important or not in November.

The Kerry camp blames Bush for the Swift boat veterans’ attack, but
anyone who has spent much time talking to the Swifties gets the sense
that they are doing it entirely for their own reasons.

And it should be noted in passing that Kerry has personally
questioned Bush’s service, while Bush has not personally questioned
Kerry’s.

In April — before the Swift boat veterans had said a word — Kerry
said Bush “has yet to explain to America whether or not, and tell the
truth, about whether he showed up for duty.” Earlier, Kerry said, “Just
because you get an honorable discharge does not, in fact, answer that
question.”

Now, after the Swift boat episode, the spotlight has returned to
Bush. That’s fine. We should know as much as we can.

And perhaps someday Kerry will release more of his military records
as well.
