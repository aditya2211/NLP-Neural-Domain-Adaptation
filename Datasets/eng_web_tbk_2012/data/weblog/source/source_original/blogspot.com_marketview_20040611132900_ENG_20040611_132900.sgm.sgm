Ever since the first whispers about Google's IPO, most investors have
feared that the stock would come public at such a ridiculously high
price that, even with a spectacularly profitable business model and some
nearly flawless execution, the price would be too high for investors to
make a real profit. We've moved on. We've grown up. Now, people wonder
if Google can even survive .

That's overstating it, I know. What they wonder is whether Google can
be anything more than what it's always been -- a great search engine
with some real grass-roots support, successful by the grace of
simplicity. Simplicity gave it that blessed, laudatory lack of clutter,
the efficient and effective text-based ads, and the support of anyone
with a dial-up connection. The problem is that customers attracted by a
simple interface are among the least loyal you can find -- witness the
fight-for-fewest-features between low-end camera companies.

The other problem? It's tough to make money branching out when your
appeal is in your focus. As the survey cited in the above-linked article
shows, most Google users don't intend to use Gmail, and Google isn't
even as popular as Yahoo! and AOL. If they continue to add features so
they can justify their likely sky-high valuation, Google risks losing a
huge chunk of their customer base to the next keep-it-simple search
engine.
