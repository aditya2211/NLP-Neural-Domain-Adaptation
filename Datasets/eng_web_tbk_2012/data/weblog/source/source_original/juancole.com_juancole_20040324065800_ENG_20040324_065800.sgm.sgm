Xinhua reports that a wide range of Iraqi political forces on Tuesday
condemned Sharon's murder of Sheikh Ahmed Yassin, a religious leader of
Hamas, the day before.

The Board of Muslim clerics in Fallujah, 50 km west of Baghdad,
"condemned the assassination and promised immediate revenge against the
coalition soldiers in Iraq." Ash-Sharq al-Awsat reports that Fallujah
was closed Tuesday in a general strike. US troops there clashed with
guerrillas in a fight that left one Iraqi dead. In Ramadi, there was a
big demonstration.

Radical Shiite cleric Muqtada al-Sadr said the attack was "criminal"
and that "the Zionists have left only one choice for the Arabs, that of
fighting and jihad".

The interim Governing Council issued a communique saying, "It is a
proof of the emptiness of the Israeli authority and a destruction of the
peace endeavors in the region . . . This operation would only
consolidate the terrorist acts in the world and would not bring peace to
the region," the message claimed.

Xinhua alleged that "Many of the Iraqis, who suffer the American
occupation of Iraq, relate their case with that of the Palestinian
people, under the Israeli occupation."

In an apparently unrelated incidents, some eleven Iraqis were killed
by snipers on Tuesday, including a group of police trainees in a bus
near Hilla and two police in Kirkuk.
