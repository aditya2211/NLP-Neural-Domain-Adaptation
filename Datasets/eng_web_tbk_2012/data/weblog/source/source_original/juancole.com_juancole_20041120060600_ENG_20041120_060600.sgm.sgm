My opinion piece on the implications of Arafat's passing for al-Qaeda
has appeared at Newsday. Excerpt:

"Arafat's secular nationalism was supple enough to compromise with
Israel and to imagine a two-state solution, even if the road of
negotiations remained rocky. The continued Israeli colonization of the
occupied Palestinian territories during the 1990s helped, along with
terrorist attacks by radical groups such as Hamas, to derail the peace
process, which Sharon had always opposed.

Arafat's death creates a vacuum in Palestinian leadership that will
not soon be filled. Sharon's assassination of major Hamas leaders has
also weakened authority structures in that party. If the Israelis and
the Palestinian leadership cannot find a way to reinvigorate the peace
process, cells of radical young Palestinians may grow up that look to
bin Laden for their cues.

Even if local Palestinian leaders remain strong enough to keep
al-Qaida out, the festering Israeli-Palestinian struggle remains among
the best recruiting posters for al-Qaida with young Muslim men.
Resolving this conflict would be the most effective weapon the United
States could deploy in its war on terror."
