I doubt the very few who actually read my blog have not come across
this yet, but I figured I would put it out there anyways. John Donovan
from Argghhh! has put out a excellent slide show on what was actually
found and fought for in Fallujah. Click here To view it.

He makes some good observations on a few of the pic's. One of the
pictures shows a flag that was found in Fallujah.

On the next two pictures he took screenshots of two beheading
video's. Compare the flags to the Fallujah one.

You have to see these slides....they are amazing. This Fallujah
operation my turn out to be the most important operation done by the US
Military since the end of the war.
