One week to elections day and the general atmosphere in the capital
is eerie, yet strikingly familiar. I suspect the streets of Baghdad will
look as if a war is looming this week. There is no doubt that many
Iraqis regard the date of 30 January as a day of renewed hope, one they
have been awaiting all their lives, but at the same time, many others
are already dreading it.

The interim government has promised security measures that would
reduce the violence on the day of elections, but I fail to see how they
will be able to protect all 5,000 (or so) balloting centres. Many voting
centres have already been successfully attacked or destroyed in many
areas.

Now that the picture is clear, the two main competing lists seem to
be the United Iraqi Coalition list and Allawi's Al-Iraqiya list. Ayad
Allawi, and other ministers running on his list, have quite expectedly
used their governmental positions in campaigning. One minister
reportedly handed out 100 dollar 'gifts' to journalists attending a
press conference for Allawi, a practice that brings back bad memories to
many Iraqis.

Sheikh Naji Al-Abbudi, a spokesman for Sistani, affirmed the claims
that the Grand Ayatollah is backing the United Iraqi Coalition list.
Indeed, Sistani's agents all over the country have been quite active in
educating Iraqi Shia on the merits of elections, which has led to the
assassination of at least two of them. Al-Abbudi stated that "His
Emminence" decided to openly support the list because "others"
(obviously a reference to Allawi) have been abusing official state
positions and media outlets in their campaigning. Again there is no
official written statement from Sistani's office confirming this
allegation, which I think is intentional.

Ahmed Al-Chalabi and defense minister Hazim Al-Sha'lan have been
engaging in shrill public attacks over the media. Chalabi describing
Sha'lan as a "Ba'athist" and a "former double agent for Saddam and the
CIA", while Sha'lan dismisses Chalabi as a "thief" and an "Iranian
stooge who longs for his own origins by defending Iran". One remark made
by Sha'lan on Al-Arabiya TV, that he couldn't say more about Chalabi
because he would embarrass himself and the viewers almost made me roll
on the floor. It was an extremely amusing episode, watching Chalabi
looking smug and amused, contrasted with Sha'lan, all serious and barely
keeping himself from swearing. Fistfights, please.

Hazim Al-Sha'lan, by the way, is the son of the late Sheikh of
Al-Khaza'il in Diwaniya and has the potential to replace former
information minister, M.S. Al-Sahaf, in his nonsensical media
statements, which can be passed as jokes.

The main Kurdish coalition list (PUK and KDP) is barely mentioned
outside the Kurdish region. Even there, many Kurds look and act as if
they are going to grab the chance to vote them out of power. I doubt
that will be the outcome though.

Many Iraqis, including conservative and religious Iraqis, are
surprisingly rooting for the Iraqi Communist party, probably in an
attempt to counter the influence of Islamists in the forthcoming
National Assembly. The Communist party has the largest number of
registered party members in the country and can be considered as the
oldest popular political party in Iraq. Its support base is much larger
than what it seems.

Several candidates were assassinated and targeted these last two
weeks, others have been forced under threats to withdraw and to follow
the example of the Islamic party. Sectarian tensions are at their
highest since April, 2004, with Sunni insurgents now openly attacking
Husseiniyas and Shia mosques.

I had an interesting conversation with a middle-aged taxi driver who
used to live in Fallujah and is now at relatives in Amiriya, Baghdad.
After asking me which tribe I belong to (thus assessing my sectarian
background) he started hurling abuses at the Shia, calling them
Persians, Majoos (fire worshippers), rabid dogs and a handful of other
descriptions that I can't mention here. He described Allawi's face as
that of a f*ed horse and he dismissed the whole government as a band of
thieves and traitors.

I didn't argue with him but I asked him what he believed would be a
viable solution to this mess. He said that resistance was the only
commonsense solution. First driving out the Americans, then fighting the
Shia back into submission (as in 1991).

Sunni Iraqis contend that elections are impossible to hold under
occupation. Leaving aside the fact that this views conflicts with other
historical examples in the region, Sunnis have never offered an
alternative choice, which eventually leads one to guess that the opinion
held by the Fallujan taxi driver above is precisely what they are
planning to implement.

I had another conversation some months ago with a retired Ba'athist
old-timer who claimed that Ba'athists have the means to stage a third
coup d'etat and return to power within 10 hours of an American
withdrawal. On sensing my incredulity to his statement he asserted that
Ba'athist cells exist in all parts of the country and that they do have
a central command, even though many have formed seperate cells (often
under Islamic labels) with their own leaderships. He said that they have
the training and the funding as well as the support of neighbouring and
regional governments.

I concur that Ba'athists and former security forces are capable of
immediately controlling at least 5 out of 18 governorates, along with
the capital, if Americans are to be removed from the picture entirely.
But I also see that as a fatal misconception, which is doing Sunnis
harm, because I don't believe the US is going anywhere so soon. Any
government that assumes power after the elections also realises this, so
not even Sistani is going to call the US to withdraw its troops, despite
what he is saying now, not until they are ensured the insurgency is out
of the picture, or that they have an alternative foreign power (in this
case Iran) to back them up.

The only hope now is that, following the elections, the National
Assembly would offer the hand of peace and reconciliation to the
dissenting parties. I would suggest going for tribal Sheikhs rather than
clerics, since they have the upper hand in their areas and can
effectively root out any Ba'athists in their midst in return for a
promise of sharing power and authority. Many of these Sheikhs have been
disenfranchised and abused over the last two years. Very recently, US
forces in Al-Anbar made a terrible blunder by accidentally killing
Abdul-Razaq Inad Al-Gu'ud, Sheikh of the Al-Bu Nimr clan from the
powerful Dulaym tribe.

Al-Gu'ud had favoured elections and was in good terms with the
government. The Gu'ud family even accepted to be offered the seat of
Al-Anbar governor some months back. The Al-Bu Nimr in Ramadi and Al-Qaim
rose in arms against Saddam in the mid-nineties following the execution
of Thamir Madhlum Al-Dulaymi, an Air Force general belonging to their
tribe. The revolt took two weeks to be suppressed by the Republican
Guard.

Another bad step was the recent arrest of Sheikh Hassan Al-Lihabi, of
the Lihaib tribe which is scattered between the governorates of
Al-Anbar, Mosul and Salah Al-Din. Al-Lihaibi was running in elections
and is now said to have withdrawn following this incident.

I believe national reconciliation to be the only path forward to a
new Iraq. The Shia cannot live without the Sunnis, and vice versa. Both
have shared this country for the last 14 centuries and there is no
possible way that one can live without the other. Even partition is not
a possibility, there are no clear borders between the two.
