Angry crowds chanted anti-American slogans in the western city of
Falluja (pop. 256,000) as the security police killed in a friendly fire
incident by US troops were buried on Saturday. Reuters reported that
"Sunni clerics in the town issued a 'Declaration by the people of
Fallujah' condemning the deaths of the security guards and police,
announcing three days of mourning, and calling for a general strike
today." It read, "The people of Fallujah condemn the massacre which was
committed on Friday against people dedicated to the protection of
Fallujah. Let aggressive (American) leaders and soldiers know that we
are capable of protecting the city's security and safety, and ask them
to lift their hands from the city." The clerics demanded talks with
local US commanders. Falluja has long been roiled by tense relations
with the US soldiers there, since local Sunnis either remain committed
to Arab nationalism or have become Sunni fundamentalists or even
radicals. Cities such as Falluja received special treatment from Saddam
and enjoyed a disproportionate share of the country's wealth and power.
They know that the American advent implies for them a demotion, and an
elevation of the Shiites and Kurds, and they refuse to go quietly. See
