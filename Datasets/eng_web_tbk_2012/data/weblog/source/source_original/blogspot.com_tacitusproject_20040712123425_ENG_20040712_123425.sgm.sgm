Though I am loathe to quote other writers at legnth in this space,
this little bit from Dan Froomkin's "White House Briefing" column in the
WashPost today is just too good to pass up (read the whole column here
):

At the Ask the President event on Friday, one of the questions was
about whether Bush has any thoughts about his memoirs.

This is one example of what happens when Bush gets a question that he
hasn't anticipated.

"Q Thank you -- I was wondering, there's a lot of talk right now
about memoirs being written with the former President. After you are
elected in 2004, what will your memoirs say about you, what will the
title be, and what will the main theme say?

"THE PRESIDENT: I appreciate that. (Laughter.) There is a painting on
my wall in the Oval -- first of all, I don't know. I'm just speculating
now. I really haven't thought about writing a book. My life is too
complicated right now trying to do my job. (Laughter.) But if -- there's
a painting on the wall in the Oval Office that shows a horseman charging
up a steep cliff, and there are at least two other horsemen following.
It's a Western scene by a guy named W.H.S. Koerner called 'A Charge to
Keep.' It's on loan, by the way, from a guy named Joe O'Neill in
Midland, Texas. He was the person, he and his wife Jan, introduced --
reintroduced me and Laura in his backyard in July of 1977. Four months
later, we were married. So he's got a -- I'm a decision-maker and I can
make good decisions. (Applause.)

"And so we sang this hymn -- this is a long story trying to get to
your answer. (Laughter.) This is not a filibuster. (Laughter.) That's a
Senate term -- particularly on good judges. (Applause.) The hymn was
sung at my first inaugural church service as governor. Laura and I are
Methodists. One of the Wesley boys wrote the hymn. The painting is based
upon the hymn called, 'A Charge to Keep.' I have. The hymn talks about
serving something greater than yourself in life. I -- which I try to do,
as best as I possibly can. (Applause.)

"The book -- I guess one way, one thing to think about it is -- one
of the themes would be, I was given a charge to keep. And I gave it all
my heart, all my energy, based upon principles that did not change once
I got into the Oval Office. (Applause.)"

Now that's a rambling response.

And I have to wonder: Did he forget that he already has a memoir
called "A Charge to Keep"?

That was the name of his "autobiography" -- ghost-written by adviser
Karen Hughes in 1999.
