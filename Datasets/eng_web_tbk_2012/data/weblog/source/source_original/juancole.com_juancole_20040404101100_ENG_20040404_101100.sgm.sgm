The Coalition decision to provoke a fight with Muqtada al-Sadr's
movement only three months before the Coalition Provisional Authority
goes out of business has to be seen as a form of gross incompetence in
governance. How did the CPA get to the point where it has turned even
Iraqi Shiites, who were initially grateful for the removal of Saddam
Hussein, against the United States? Where it risks fighting dual Sunni
Arab and Shiite insurgencies simultaneously, at a time when US troops
are rotating on a massive scale and hoping to downsize their forces in
country? At a time when the Spanish, Thai and other contingents are
already committed to leaving, and the UN is reluctant to get involved?

One answer is that the Pentagon prevented the State Department from
running the CPA. State is the body with experience in international
affairs and administration. The civilians in the Department of Defense
only know how to blow things up. Rumsfeld, Wolfowitz and Feith staffed
the CPA with Neoconservatives, most of whom had no administrative
experience, no Arabic, and no respect for Muslim culture (or knowledge
about it). They actively excluded State Department Iraq hands like Tom
Warrick. (Only recently have a few experienced State Department Arabists
been allowed in to try to begin mopping up the mess.) The Neocons in the
CPA have all sorts of ulterior motives and social experiments they want
to impose on the Iraqi people, including Polish-style economic shock
therapy, some sort of sweetheart deal for Israel, and maybe even
breaking the country up into three parts.

The Washington Monthly's Who's Who of Neocons in Iraq helps explain
the extreme incompetence and possibly double-dealing of many in the CPA.

Sept. 11 Commission member Philip Zelikow, who is close to the Bush
administration, admitted on Sept. 10, 2002, that the ulterior motive of
the Bush administration for the Iraq War was to "protect Israel,"
according to the Asian Times .

I have long been a trenchant critic of the Sadrists. But they haven't
been up to anything extraordinary as far as I can see in recent weeks.
Someone in the CPA sat down and thought up ways to stir them up by
closing their newspaper and issuing 28 arrest warrants and taking in
people like Yaqubi. This is either gross incompetence or was done with
dark ulterior motives that can scarcely be guessed at.

There is a classical logical fallacy, post hoc ergo propter hoc (Z
happens after X, therefore Z is caused by X), and I keep revising this
posting this evening because I don't want to fall into it. But
sometimes, of course, when Z happens after X it is because of X. So I
may as well just come out with it: It is pretty suspicious, given the
Neocon predominance in the CPA and in the upper reaches of the Defense
Department that on April 2 AP reported of Muqtada:

' A radical Shiite Muslim cleric has expressed solidarity with the
militant Palestinian group Hamas and said that he should be considered
the group's "striking arm" in Iraq. "I have said and I repeat my
expression of solidarity which Hassan Nasrallah called for to stand with
Hamas," Shiite cleric Muqtada al-Sadr said Friday in a reference to
Nasrallah, the leader of the militant Lebanese Shiite group Hezbollah.
Last month, Nasrallah announced that his party would close ranks with
Hamas. "Let (Hamas) consider me their striking arm in Iraq because the
fate of Iraq and Palestine is the same," al-Sadr said during a Friday
prayer sermon in Kufa, his home base south of Baghdad. He did comment on
what he meant by the phrase. '

And on April 3 his chief aide in Najaf was suddenly arrested along
with 13 other members of his organization, and the Coalition forces are
put into violent conflict with his organization, which leaves 7 US
soldiers dead. The Army is unlikely to forgive or forget; but who
provoked it and why? I'm not even in Iraq and I could have predicted to
you the consequences of doing what the CPA has been doing. Anthony
Shadid of the Washington Post reveals that the warrants for the arrests
had been issued months be for. Why were they suddenly acted on Saturday?
