President Bush pinched a few nerves yesterday with his choice of
words: WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. Muslim groups criticized President
Bush on Thursday for calling a foiled plot to blow up airplanes part of
a "war with Islamic fascists," saying the term could inflame anti-Muslim
tensions.

U.S. officials have said the plot, thwarted by Britain, to blow up
several aircraft over the Atlantic bore many of the hallmarks of al
Qaeda.

"We believe this is an ill-advised term and we believe that it is
counterproductive to associate Islam or Muslims with fascism," said
Nihad Awad, executive director of the Council on American-Islamic
Relations advocacy group. Which is why he didn't say we're at war with
Islamic people. We're at war with Islamic fascists. By using the word
"Islamic" as an adjective Bush was purposely not associating Muslims
with fascism, hence the qualifier. And if you haven't heard by now, the
roster of suspected terrorists has not a Tom, Dick or Harry among them:

Umir Hussain, 24, London E14

Muhammed Usman Saddique, 24, London E17

Waheed Zaman, 22, London E17

Assan Abdullah Khan, 22, London E17

Waseem Kayani, 28, High Wycombe

Waheed Arafat Khan, 24, London E17

Cossor Ali, 24, London E17

Tayib Rauf, 21, Birmingham

Ibrahim Savant, 26, London E17

Osman Adam Khatib, 20, London E17

Shamin Mohammed Uddin, 36, Stoke Newington

Amin Asmin Tariq, 23, London E17

Shazad Khuram Ali, 27, High Wycombe

Tanvir Hussain, 24, London E10

Umar Islam, 28, (born Brian Young) High Wycombe

Assad Sarwar, 25, High Wycombe

Abdullah Ali, 26, London E17

Abdul Muneem Patel, 17, London E5

Nabeel Hussain, 21, Waltham Forest Lest you be confused with the
suspects from an earlier plot foiled in Canada a few months ago: Fahim
Ahmad, 21, Toronto;

Zakaria Amara, 20, Mississauga, Ont.;

Asad Ansari, 21, Mississauga;

Shareef Abdelhaleen, 30, Mississauga;

Qayyum Abdul Jamal, 43, Mississauga;

Mohammed Dirie, 22, Kingston, Ont.;

Yasim Abdi Mohamed, 24, Kingston;

Jahmaal James, 23, Toronto;

Amin Mohamed Durrani, 19, Toronto;

Steven Vikash Chand alias Abdul Shakur, 25, Toronto;

Ahmad Mustafa Ghany, 21, Mississauga;

Saad Khalid, 19, of Eclipse Avenue, Mississauga. We've got a Steven,
the one word that didn't crash my spell-check, despite it being followed
by a Vikash Chand Abdul Shakur. Folks, if it's Islamic, and fascist,
it's an Islamic fascist. But because we don't want to sound hateful we
must pretend everyone's a possible suspect and make airline travel more
miserable than it's ever been.
