Warren Buffett is giving away 85% of his wealth , mostly to the Bill
and Melinda Gates Foundation. It's a move that really worries me;
Buffett's usual justification for keeping most of his money was that he
was still compounding the value of his fortune at a pretty high rate, so
any gifts now would mean significantly less money for the foundation
later. It's a little hard to parse, but at this point his ostensible
view is that the Gateses are very good money-redistributors, and he
wants them to have the money as soon as possible. Which essentially
sounds like he's worried that Bill or Melinda are going to die soon. I
assume his actual reason is that he's worried that Berkshire Hathaway
just can't grow quickly enough to justify his usual charity policy.

I'm not sure how the market will react. It doesn't change the
company's intrinsic worth, and as the article notes, the company might
be added to a major index once the shares get more liquid. On the other
hand, this is essentially a statement that the company is overpriced
from the guy who knows it best -- and happens to be the best investor of
the last century.

em ... no ... the Gates foundation mainly invests in medical research
and education, that means donating now adds a tremendous value compared
to donating in ten years.

Because the 10.000.000 people dying from malaria will otherwise be
dead. i.e.

He's not giving 85% away, he's giving a number of shares each year
that decrease in number at the rate of 5% a year (until gone?). He
mentions his wife's death having an effect on him. It sounds pretty
rational that he's saying that Bill and Melinda are at a prime spot, so
starting the money hose now is a good idea, but Buffet is still keeping
most of his donation inside of Berkshire where it will compound.
