In the eastern city of Baqubah, guerrillas detonated a car bomb
outside a police station, killing several people.

The US lost yet another helicopter to hostile fire near Habbaniyah in
the Sunni heartland, but this time the crew was safe. In Fallujah,
hundreds of demonstrators came out against US troops when they briefly
arrested a yound newlywed bride. (I hope that the US army got an
enormous amount of information from her relatives, because otherwise
this move was a bad, bad tradeoff). The US troops fired into the hostile
crowd, killing 4.

It seems clear to me that the manhunt for high Baath officials in the
Sunni heartland is being done wrong, or at least in ways that are bad
for US standing with local Iraqis.
