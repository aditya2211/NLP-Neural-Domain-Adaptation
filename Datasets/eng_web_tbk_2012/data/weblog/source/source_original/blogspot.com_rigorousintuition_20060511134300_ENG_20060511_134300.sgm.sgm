When the cities are on fire with the burning flesh of men

Just remember that death is not the end

And you search in vain to find just one law abiding citizen

Just remember that death is not the end - Bob Dylan

Afraid I don't have time today to discuss these, but some stories
need attention:

From Wednesday's Mirror the headline, "Have 200,000 AK47s Fallen Into
the Hands of Iraq Terrorists?" (also see this thread on the RI
discussion board):

Some 200,000 guns the US sent to Iraqi security forces may have been
smuggled to terrorists, it was feared yesterday.

The 99-tonne cache of AK47s was to have been secretly flown out from
a US base in Bosnia. But the four planeloads of arms have vanished.

Orders for the deal to go ahead were given by the US Department of
Defense. But the work was contracted out via a complex web of private
arms traders .

And the Moldovan airline used to transport the shipment was blasted
by the UN in 2003 for smuggling arms to Liberia, human rights group
Amnesty has discovered.

It follows a separate probe claiming that thousands of guns meant for
Iraq's police and army instead went to al-Qaeda .

Amnesty chief spokesman Mike Blakemore said: "It's unbelievable that
no one can account for 200,000 assault rifles. If these weapons have
gone missing it's a terrifying prospect." American defence chiefs hired
a US firm to take the guns, from the 90s Bosnian war, to Iraq.

But air traffic controllers in Baghdad have no record of the flights,
which supposedly took off between July 2004 and July 2005. A coalition
forces spokesman confirmed they had not received "any weapons from
Bosnia" and added they were "not aware of any purchases for Iraq from
Bosnia". Nato and US officials have already voiced fears that Bosnian
arms - sold by US, British and Swiss firms - are being passed to
insurgents. A NATO spokesman said: "There's no tracking mechanism to
ensure they don't fall into the wrong hands. There are concerns that
some may have been siphoned off." This year a newspaper claimed two UK
firms were involved in a deal in which thousands of guns for Iraqi
forces were re-routed to al-Qaeda.

The Moldovan airline is Aerocom, and yes , it's one of Victor Bout's
.

It's always a bang-your-head-against-the-wall moment, reading again
the play the incompetence theory receives, even from some of the
Administration's harshest mainstream critics. But then, even to talk of
an "administration" may be misdirection at this point, given how little
representative government means in the United States these days, and how
much of "national security" has been privatized into a global gangland
of drugs and guns.

Like the tens of billions of dollars that have been "lost" in Iraq,
planeloads of arms don't just "vanish"; not when the Pentagon contracts
the work to an international criminal of Bout's untouchable stature. But
Bout's name isn't likely to be mentioned in whatever coverage this story
receives, before it sinks like so many others beneath the media's
frothing triviality.

Meanwhile, a decision's been reached in the trial of Toledo priest
Gerald Robinson. And it's guilty :

The Rev. Gerald Robinson appeared stony-faced as the jury's guilty
verdict was read, and he blinked repeatedly and glanced at his lawyers
before being led away in handcuffs.

...

The crime occurred in the sacristy adjoining the hospital chapel in
downtown Toledo on the Saturday before Easter in 1980. Investigators
said the nun, Margaret Ann Pahl, 71, was strangled and then stabbed,
with nine wounds on her chest forming the shape of an inverted cross, a
well-recognized Satanic symbol.

An altar cloth was draped over her half-naked body, which was posed
as if she had been sexually assaulted.

"It was about how he could humiliate her the most," prosecutor Dean
Mandros said in closing arguments. "He left a message for everyone to
see ... maybe to God himself."

After the sentencing one of Robinson's tearful supporters "turned to
Claudia Vercellotti, a local leader of the Survivors Network for Those
Abused by Priests [SNAP], who had helped reopen the case, and told her,
'I hope you rot in hell!'"

From SNAP's statement on the Robinson conviction:

More than ever, police and prosecutors have the tools and the will to
go after horrific crimes, even when the defendants are seemingly
powerful individuals or institutions .

When victims and witnesses stay silent, nothing changes. When victims
and witnesses speak up, at least sometimes a child is protected, the
truth is exposed, and justice is done.

The murder weapon, Robinson's letter opener:

Finally, from an email, a follow-up on the reopening of the
investigation into the Atlanta Child Murders :

Dekalb County Police Chief Louis Graham...the man who reopened the
investigations last year, is mysteriously stepping down. And of all the
people who the county is getting to find a replacement...is none other
than Lee Brown, the original supervisor of the Atlanta PD, who was in
office during the murders and the subsequent investigation.

SNAP is right in part. Police and prosecutors have the tools. The
will is another matter. Some do, individually. But institutionally?
That's still the domain of those who don't.

talk about law enforcement not having the will...

CRACKDOWN ON POLYGAMY GROUP

Small polygamous groups have existed in the southwestern US under the
watchful yet fairly benign eye of authorities ever since a sect known as
the Fundamentalist Latter Day Saints (FLDS) separated itself from
mainstream Mormonism in 1890.

...

Now, FLDS leader Warren Jeffs has been added to the FBI's list of
"Ten Most Wanted Fugitives," a move that caps law enforcement's dramatic
change of approach toward the polygamous group in recent
years...[because of] the impact that the group's practices, law
enforcement officials say, are having on the most vulnerable within the
sect, particularly children and women.

When the FLDS under Mr. Jeffs (and his father before him) grew to
some 10,000 followers in several southwestern communities with estimated
assets of $110 million; when it became clear that government officials,
school authorities, and police in those communities had become
intertwined with the sect; when ex-members increasingly reported child
and sexual abuse charges (mainly involving underage girls forced to
marry older men); and when the sect began to use secluded compounds,
state and federal authorities started to crack down more vigorously.

...

Specifically, Jeffs is charged in Utah and Arizona with sexual
assault of underage girls and with arranging "spiritual" marriages for
girls and older men. At weekend press conferences in Salt Lake City and
Phoenix, FBI and state officials said Jeffs "is considered armed and
dangerous and may be traveling with armed bodyguards." In the past, he
has talked in apocalyptic terms about a violent end to the world,
according to former members.

...

As with Christian Identity and other hate-related philosophies tied
to the Aryan Nations and the neo-Nazi Creativity Movement, Jeffs has
preached racism as well. "The black race is the people through which the
devil has always been able to bring evil unto the earth," Jeffs has said
as cited by the Southern Poverty Law Center's "Intelligence Report."

An editorial in the church-owned Deseret Morning News in Salt Lake
City earlier this year acknowledged that "the state's history, a
conservative belief in free choice, and an unwillingness to stir up a
hornet's nest in the national media have likely all contributed to the
kid-glove approach lawmakers and law-enforcement officers have taken
when dealing with polygamous communities."

Then, of course, there is the evidence the jury did not hear about in
the Robinson case...

Funny how some things are squirelled away by well-meaning
prosecutors... Maybe because they hint at a larger conspiracy/network of
abusers/satanic underground?

</en>

<en=8>


I read of a case not long ago when some people were trying to get a
polygamous judge taken off the bench for not obeying state law. Of
course law enforcement has dragged it's feet when members are taking
part in the activity themselves. Personally I don't give a damn what
adults do to one another as long as there is no abuse invovled. It is
the marrying off of young girls to older men often close relatives that
enfurates me. Also these cults have multimillions yet the women and kids
live in poverty so the leaders can live the high life. In the Warren
Jeffs cult he reassigns wives if the husband displeases him or to reward
the new husband. Husbands marry mothers and teen daughters at the same
time. a rare form of retardation is showing up in that group more than
anywhere else in the world. It is genetic and the child needs to get the
gene from both parents to turn into a vegetable instead of a thinking
child. The doctor begs them to stop intermarrying but they say they have
to keep the blood pure. look up fumarase deficiency for more info. Also
look up the kingston family. One member actually was convicted of
beating his teen daughter unconcious when she ran away from 'marriage'
to her father's own brother. no one was charged for forced marriage,
only the beating.

<en=9>


So we "lost" some weapon? It's

a good thing too. We wouldn't want those terrorists to run out of
shit to shoot at us. Then the war might stop & all those juicy profits
would just evaporate.

What's a few dead soldiers in comparison to keeping all those defense
contractors awash in all that tax cash?

They really are milking the incompetence angle though, aren't they?

Just another big Iraq whoopsie daisy, huh?

Christ, you'd think America would get a bit tired of these guys
treating her like she was populated with nothing but gullible idiots.

I suppose that it's damn lucky for the GOP that she is populated with

US outsourcing special ops, intelligence to Iraq terror group,
intelligence officials say

The Pentagon is bypassing official US intelligence channels and
turning to a dangerous and unruly cast of characters in order to create
strife in Iran in preparation for any possible attack, former and
current intelligence officials say...

http://www.rawstory.com/news/2006/US_outsourcing_special_operations_intelligence_gathering_0413.html

A country deserves the leaders it has, my friends...

</en>

<en=11>


And MEK -- the Iranian (not Iraqi) terror group in question -- is
itself unquestionably a cult:

As the leaders like to boast, the Mujahedeen is a family affair.
(''We have three generations of martyrs: grandmothers, mothers,
daughters.'') Most of the girls I was meeting had grown up in Mujahedeen
schools in Ashraf, where they lived separated from their parents. Family
visits were allowed on Thursday nights and Fridays. When Iraq invaded
Kuwait, many of these girls were transported to Jordan and then smuggled
to various countries -- Germany, France, Canada, Denmark, England, the
United States -- where they were raised by guardians who were usually
Mujahedeen supporters. When they were 18 or 19, many of them decided to
come back to Iraq and fill the ranks of the youngest Mujahedeen
generation. Though ''decided'' is probably not the right word, since
from the day they were born, these girls and boys were not taught to
think for themselves but to blindly follow their leaders. ''Every
morning and night, the kids, beginning as young as 1 and 2, had to stand
before a poster of Massoud and Maryam, salute them and shout praises to
them,'' Nadereh Afshari, a former Mujahedeen deep-believer, told me.
Afshari, who was posted in Germany and was responsible for receiving
Mujahedeen children during the gulf war, said that when the German
government tried to absorb Mujahedeen children into their education
system, the Mujahedeen refused. Many of the children were sent to
Mujahedeen schools, particularly in France. The Rajavis, Afshari went on
to say, ''saw these kids as the next generation's soldiers. They wanted
to brainwash them and control them.'' Which may explain the pattern to
their stories: a journey to self-empowerment and the enlightenment of
self-sacrifice inspired by the light and wisdom of Maryam and Massoud.

Bush successfully makes Satan look good in comparison.

Or something like that.

http://www.laweekly.com/general/features/satan-loves-you/13454/

"Another generation of heavy metal has taken over, and -- sorry -- it
ain't just about strippers and dope. Okay, it's partly about strippers
and dope. And we'll get around to that. But more and more, as metal
evolves into a huge international music that belongs to everyone, it has
gotten to be something weirder. It's become a guardian of morality --
not church morality; real morality. Praise be: Given the void in
responsible behavior among governments, police, educational
establishments and religions, the task of guiding our youth down the
path of righteousness has fallen to... Satan"

Richard, i agree, Hmmmmmm. How are chants of death and suicide ...
morality. What about Manson's tees bearing the message, "Kill your
parents". And were the Columbine killers acting out this "real morality"
when they indescriminately murdered their classmates. They were death
metal brainwashed fans, literally fulfilling the death metal paradigm,
er ... morality. (not church morality, no that is phoney, love thy
neighbor ... hell no, kill thy neighbor - now that is REAL MORALITY
?????) So, hmmmm indeed. I detect the hissing lisp of the lying serpent
in this article. The deathly inversion of truth, ala satanism.

</en>

<en=19>


I think the jury's still out on exactly who did the brainwashing when
in regard to the Columbine killers. Perhaps we should look at the death
metal phenomenon less as an invitation to violence than as a
couter-cultural response to the over hypocrisy of a large percentage of
the 'Church-Morality' crowd, which gives a lot of lip service to loving
thy neighbor, but doesn't apply that love very far beyond their own
congregation. The last I checked, the Satanists have a long way to go to
catch up with the death and destruction dealt out by self-proclaimed
(though false) Christians. Irony is dead...Long live Irony!

Well, it's not as simple and clear cut as all that.

We're entering into some interesting and perhaps previously
unexplored socio-political-spiritual territory here that may require
further examination and serious introspection.

The Kevin Coogan publication posted on the previous thread might
serve as a good launching point for further discussion. The following
quote is from that Coogan article:

Imaginary evil is romantic and varied; real evil is gloomy,
monotonous, barren, boring. Imaginary good is boring; real good is
always new, marvelous, intoxicating.

that they have ulterior or hidden motives. They trust you and me to be

To not buying the BS

& here I am thinking that I really must be getting old.

Since the article was specifically about "death metal" I guess the
author missed this little tidbit or we just have waaaaaaaaaaaaay
different definitions of morality:

http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/programmes/this_world/4446342.stm

One man's relentless search for his missing son led him to uncover
one of the most shocking crimes in post-war Italy - a tale of satanism
and violence that has gripped the country for more than a year.

In January 1998 Fabio Tollis and Chiara Marino, both just 16,
disappeared.

They had been drinking at a pub called the Midnight - the centre of
the heavy metal scene in Milan - and they never came home.

The police and many of their friends just thought they had run off
together. But their parents refused to accept this.

Michele Tollis, Fabio's father, began to attend metal concerts and
festivals across Europe, handing out leaflets and quizzing Fabio's
friends.

Fabio and his friends were into the most extreme forms of heavy metal
music - death metal and black metal, music obsessed with images of
murder and satanism - and the role of this music is central to the
story.

No one can contradict me when I say that heavy metal and satanism are
closely linked

Michele Tollis

It emerged that Chiara, the girl who disappeared with Fabio, had a
collection of satanic literature and paraphernalia in her bedroom.

During this search, Michele Tollis became convinced that satanism had
something to do with his son's disappearance.

"No one can contradict me when I say that heavy metal and satanism
are closely linked. They're inseparable," he says.

</en>

<en=25>


Yeah, I think Jeff wrote on one of his posts here in the past several
months: "To hell with death". I wholly agree, and would expand that
statement to include: "To hell with death metal".

The freaky thing here is that these bozos are seriously claiming the
moral high ground ? ? ? ? ?

Talk about a beat-your-head-against-the-wall moment!

And for 'Smartwolf' above, think about the inversion principle being
employed. They are doing it deliberately.

Do you really think GWB, and neocons in general are representative of
true followers of Jesus of Nazareth? (I know, ignorant question) Then
why call them, or any other phonies 'Christians', even if they
themselves claim the appellation.

They are merely imposters. Everything they claim is a lie, and this
above all. So why even credit their claims? This only serves their
purposes. They want to be identified as 'Christians', and I fully
suspect that for some of them, the motivation behind their subterfuge is
more than mere political advantage, and has a lot more to do with the
black magician's practice of the inversion principle.

We need to be more 'rigorous' about how we perceive these people. See
them as they are, not for what they claim to be.

... the most extreme forms of heavy metal music - death metal and
black metal, music obsessed with images of murder and satanism - and the
role of this music is central to the story.

Almost all of the avant guard art movements of the early 20th Century
(except for Italian Futurism) were labeled 'degenerate' by the National
Socialists. Adolf Hitler even held an exhibition of 'degenerate art' in
1937, while curating a parallel show of 'Aryan' art across the street.
The German Expressionist movement was destroyed as a result. Here's a
quick overview of the Entartete Kunst (Degenerate Art) exhibit of 1937:

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Degenerate_art

Ironically (or perhaps not), the notion of the 'degenerate' and
'degenerate art' was appropriated by the Nazis and its origins can be
traced back to Jewish 'intellectual' Max Nordau and a 1892 book he
authored called Degeneration. . Nordau was also the co founder of the
World Zionist Organization.

When the apparently cognitively functional take actions that seem
senseless and incompetent, it is a most certain sign that they have
ulterior or hidden motives. They trust you and me to be befuddled by
their actions, while they "do as they wilt."

A question:

Are the adherent of 'Crowleyan Thelema' and others of similar ilk
appropriating or appropriating from the appropriators to redirect
'energy?' Does this reappropriation lead to or originate from the same
place? Seems as if there is a clear distinction being made between the
'imaginary' Whore of Babalon and the actually Whore of Babylon, which is
this global system. Is the distinction accurate and valid? Does the
distinction actually exist? This is where the socio- political aspect of
this conundrum comes into play.

Confused?

Good.

Here's another interesting example:

John Balance from Coil. (Don't wish to use Wikipedia again, it's just

information.)

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Balance

http://www.guardian.co.uk/obituaries/story/0,3604,1371372,00.html

Balance died in 2004 after a 'fall.'

He blended belief systems such as Shamanism, Christianity, Buddhism,
Paganism, Hermeticism and Gnosticism and imbued Coil's vast output with
a magickal current designed to have a functionally transcendent effect
on listeners.

http://www.thetruthseeker.co.uk/article.asp?id=4503

I don't know if this has been verified. But succintly making point
after succint point, the text of the letter stands on its own merit,
regardless.

I like to imagine the thought processes going on in W's head if he
were to actually read the letter, but it is hard to picture him actually
reading this letter.

As I read the letter, I considered the vast contrast between mind and
morality of whoever wrote it, vs. that of the mind of the man who once
said "Bring it on!"

Tronicus:

Simply, the questions permeate the entire 'Western (Mystery)
Tradition' and perhaps 'Eastern' as well, as they relate to the
confluence of politics and spirituality. For example, is the system of
Crowleyan Thelema a failed alchemical process? Or was it supposed to
initially be a process of alchemical appropriation? Similarly, is
invoking ancient Egyptian gods and goddesses a reaffirmation of an
oppressive and hierarchical system? In my opinion, people can no longer
afford to partition out and compartmentalize personal spiritual and
political systems. The 'high weirdness' and more hardcore political
'factions' must perhaps integrate and arrive at a synthesis. In regards
to death metal, the problem is, once again, a question of education,
history and the vacuous lack of perspective in American culture. Shall
we censor the works of poet Charles Baudelaire as well? Baudelaire was
perhaps one of the first 'death metal' artists.

</en>

<en=38>


Tronicus, if you're still checking this thread:

A bit of a knee-jerk reaction from me there, and I apologize for my
over-generalizations. My real problem is with literalist
fundamentalists, of any religion. True believers are dangerous animals.
I just get hung up on 'Christians', as they're the dominant form where I
come from. Also, I'm quite clear on the fact that those in power now
(and, in general, most anyone at the top of a pyrimidal power structure)
tend to use the dominant religion as a cloak to hide their true
motivations and as a tool to control the masses. It boggles the mind
that ANYONE can take at face value Bush's claims to be a christian, yet
many seem to do just that. I seem to remember something about 'by their
works shall ye know them."

I do get my hackles up a bit when people haul out the old
'Rock-N-Roll made them do it' argument. Whie I don't subscribe to the
notion that the things we watch or listen to have no effect on our
behavior (which I think is patently rediculous), it does bother me when
people single out a specific group of people to pin the blame on.
Sub-cultures (as the lable implies) do not develope in a vacuum.

Again, I think the problem is people who sink to far into their own
egos, and begin to take their personal metaphors a bit too literaly.
These people are dangerous wether they're head-banging to 'Canibal
Corpse' or humming along to 'Onward Christian Soldiers'. (The mixing of
religion and militarism is a whole other topic....)

I have nothing but respect for people who adhear to non-violence,
forgiveness, and charity, but it's important to remember that Christians
(or 'Smartwolves') do not have a monopoly on that particular lifestyle.

Peace.

one of the US's local stooges and they then have a pretext to ramp the
spin up a notch or two.
