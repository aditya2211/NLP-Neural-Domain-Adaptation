Elena's motorcycle tour through the region around Chernobyl has
revived interest in one of the most serious nuclear disasters in
history.

We all know what happened, but even to this day, there are many
different versions and opinions on how it happened and what effect
Chernobyl will have on the health of people affected by the fallout.

UPDATE: Now you can tour Chernobyl and write your own story.

This is not a post about fault-finding or assigning blame. It is a
time to learn what happened and how it may affect the future.

There was a soothing authoritative UNSCEAR (United Nations Scientific
Committee on the Effects of Atomic Radiation ) report in 2000 on the
health effects of Chernobyl confirming that there was no scientific
evidence of any significant radiation-related health effects to most
people exposed. This was heavily promoted by the Australasian Radiation
Protection Society in a press release titled THE MYTHS OF CHERNOBYL
which contained the following:

One of the most widespread myths of recent times is that the
Chernobyl nuclear reactor accident in 1986 caused many thousands of
extra cancer deaths in neighbouring regions, and that public health has
been severely affected by exposure to radiation.

Many people still believe that to be true, even though the Ministry
of Russian Federation on Civil Defence, Emergencies and Elimination of
Conseguences of Natural Disasters (EMERCOM of Russia) reported this in
1996:

CHERNOBYL ACCIDENT: TEN YEARS ON In the last decade, there has been a
real and significant increase in childhood and, to a certain extent,
adult carcinoma of the thyroid in contaminated regions of the former
Soviet Union (Wi940) which should be attributed to the Chernobyl
accident until proven otherwise.

The prestigious IAEA (International Atomic Energy Agency) published
an early report on Chernobyl which was based on information from Russian
sources and stated that there was no significant health effects.
However, in April 2001, the IAEA published Fifteen Years after the
Chernobyl Accident - Lessons learned. which contradict the earlier
reports.

Here are some excerpts:

The dramatic increase in radiation-induced thyroid cancers in
children and adolescents in Belarus, Russia, and Ukraine, which have
been observed since 1991, continues to this day.

...a drop in the birth rate, a deterioration in women's reproductive
health, an increase in complications during pregnancy and birth, and a
deterioration in neonatal health....

The dynamics of change in the state of health of children affected by
the Chernobyl accident in all three countries - Belarus, Russia, and
Ukraine - in the post-accident period is characterized by persistent
negative tendencies: the morbidity rate is going up, the number of
really healthy children is dropping, and disability is increasing .

As a parent, I can well imagine how painful it must be for those
families whose children are succumbing to radiation poisoning.

There is a lot to learn about Chernobyl. Being well-informed will
give you certainty and that is desirable in a world of conflicting
reports. There are a wealth of references on Chernobyl. Read some of the
following links and draw your own conclusions.

These links present the many viewpoints that existed and still exist
about the disaster called Chernobyl:

I would be interested in hearing what conclusions you reached and
what you found that was most convincing. radiation: As a child in the
50's I had a lot of glandular problems and they treated it with
radiation therapy (primitive at best!) and stopped when a lesion on my
neck started enlarging--they said it was not CA but stopped the
treatments.... Remember the old shoe sizing machines that was a form of
radiation xray? That too was stopped. Don't have to mention what
radiation has done and is still doing to Hirsohima & Nagaski
folks--there can be no doubts about the effects of radiation in
Chernobyl.......

The Chernobyl Children's Project
(http://www.adiccp.org/home/default.asp) offers several ways to help the
children of that region. One of them is the Rest and Recuperation
Program, wherein a child can come to the US for a few weeks in the
summer. Even a little time spent receiving wholesome, uncontaminated
food, good medical care, etc. can add years to their lives. S. and I
have an acquaintance who has hosted several of these children for many
years; to see these little ones breaks the heart. The urge to protect
and gather them all in is almost overwhelming, and makes me more
grateful for the blessings I have. Take care, my friend, Linda

I'm sorry to say Elena's story has been revealed to be a fake.
