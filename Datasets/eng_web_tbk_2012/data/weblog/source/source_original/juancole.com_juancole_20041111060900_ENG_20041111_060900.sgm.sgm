US Marines moved into most of Fallujah on Wednesday, though they were
still meeting pockets of resistance.

The Fallujah fighting has killed fair numbers of Iraqi noncombatants,
including Shaikh Abdul Wahhab al-Janabi of the respected Association of
Muslim Scholars.

Armed clashes broke out in several northern Iraqi cities on
Wednesday, leaving some 22 persons dead in Mosul, Baiji, and Tuz.
Hundreds of persons mounted demonstrations against the Fallujah campaign
in Tikrit and Huwaijah, as well, according to az-Zaman . The battles and
demonstrations were provoked by the US assault on Fallujah.

Guerrillas threatened to assassinate Prime Minister Iyad Allawi and
Minister of Defense Hazem Shaalan in retaliation for the attack.
Allawi's aged cousin and the man's wife and daughter-in-law were
abducted and guerrillas threaten to behead them if the Fallujah compaign
is not stopped. In Iraqi society, PM Allawi is responsible for
protecting his clan, including especially his first cousins, so this
kidnapping makes him look weak and brings substantial shame on him.

The US Marines took most of Fallujah Wednesday, but still face
pockets of resistance. If Samarra and other cities are any guide, those
pockets of resistance could go on bedeviling the US for some time to
come.

The intrepid Ed Wong of the NYT has more on the Sunni boycott of the
elections. He reports that the Iraqi Islamic Party, which had earlier
been absolutely committed to getting out the Sunni vote, is now wavering
and saying their position will depend on the situation. The outbreak of
demonstrations and violence throughout the Sunni Arab regions on
Wednesday did not bode well for Sunni participation in the January
elections.

Jim Lobe has more on the political implications of the Fallujah
assault, both in Iraq and in Washington.

some fun with my Weblog.

catch up the next couple of days.]
