I ran across this item on the Internet.

Sooooo. The United States goes into a war zone and evacuates a bunch
of U.S. citizens (most of whom were "dual-citizens"). Then, eschewing
normal procedure, the Department of State waived the fees that they
charge for evacuating U.S. citizen.

Why? To pander to the mythical "Arab street", of course.

Now, I would argue that one could have reasonably predicted that some
form of military violence was likely to occur in Lebanon (considering
that the country has been experiencing some form of conflict for
approximately the last 32 years). In other words, those Americans were
there by their own choice, mired in a situation that was totally
predictable. Yet we didn't charge them for the evacuation. This is
unlike the situation last year in Asia when we evacuated U.S. citizens
from areas that were hit by the tsunami - a phenomenon that is much less
predictable than the Hezbollah-provoked destruction that rained down on
Lebanon.

And what do we get for this effort? A lawsuit.

That's right, folks. The American-Arab Discrimination Committee is
suing Condoleeza Rice and Donald Rumsfeld, charging that they mismanaged
the evacuation efforts.

Here's an excerpt from the article:

Nina Chahine, 19, who with her family was among the named plaintiffs
in the lawsuit, said her wedding in the southern city of Tyre was set
for July 13.

The wedding had to be postponed as family members fled the outbreak
of the war, she said.

"We were on the road and the first bridge was bombed and we drove
home and all the other bridges were bombed and there was absolutely no
way for us to get home," Chahine told reporters outside federal court in
Detroit.

"We were all American citizens and there was no way that anybody
helped us. No communications nothing. I was on my way to my wedding
fearing death, basically."

Chahine said her immediate family spent about $20,000 to return to
Detroit via Syria and Jordan.

Dear Nina,

Here's a tip: Don't get married in countries that house illegal
militias that attack other countries and hence are likely to come under
counter-attack!

Crap like this sure makes me want to rush right out and rescue people
from dilemmas of their own making.
