There has been random speculation about Google developiong a new
browser and/or acquiring Firefox. It is true that Google has been in
acquisition mode. They have acquired Urchin, Zipdash, Applied Semantics,
Picasa, Blogger, and satellite imaging company Keyhole, so why not
Firefox?

I have no inside information, but I have been following links today
that strongly indicate that Google is damn serious about securing
permanent control of the leading edge browser technology in Firefox.

Ben Goodger is the lead engineer for Mozilla Firefox. He announced
this in January:

As of January 10, 2005, my source of income changed from The Mozilla
Foundation to Google, Inc. of Mountain View, California. My role with
Firefox and the Mozilla project will remain largely unchanged, I will
continue doing much the same work as I have described above - with the
new goal of successful 1.1, 1.5 and 2.0 releases. I remain devoted
full-time to the advancement of Firefox, the Mozilla platform and web
browsing in general.

He also announced this in January:

Welcome Darin! I just want to extend a big &quot;Welcome!&quot; to
Darin Darin Fisher who joined me at Google this week. 2005 is going to
rock!

Darin Fisher wrote this response on January 25, 2005:

Me and the big &quot;G&quot; Following on the heels of Ben's
annoucement yesterday, I thought I'd post that I have joined Google as
well. Like Ben, I will still be very much involved with the Mozilla
project and community :-) Posted by darin

Ben made another announcement on March 28, 2005:

I want to use this opportunity to welcome Brian Ryner to Google!
Brian has been one of the most crucial elements to the success of
Mozilla software over the past few years,... Great to have you on board!

Now, none of this has been confirmed by Google at the present time,
but it's an old adage that you follow the money to see who is behind
something. In this case, following the talent leads me to think that
Google will be making an announcement this year that formalizes the
Google-Mozilla/Firefox relationship.

If you have not already seen the Flash movie Epic , you should take a
few minutes and view the future history of media as conceived by Robin
Sloan and Matt Thompson, with music by Aaron McLeran. In this movie
Google and Amazon (GOOGLEZON ) create a brave new world of media in
2008.

This is one thought-provoking film. Every move Google makes brings
this particular future closer. Just one small commment - it's not
possible, as far as I know, for Google to "Aquire" Firefox. They already
have rights to take it, alter it, and release those changes to the world
- this is what the whole open source thing is about. I'm inclined to say
that google is doing what they can to both shape and support the growth
of the most popular non-Microsoft browser out there - by taking on the
leading lights in Firefox development, they're ensuring the continued
life of the project, and ensuring (not that I think they need to) that
their voice will be heard admidst the higher echelons of the firefox
development team. It's this sort of enlightened self interest that keeps
large open source projects alive.

Fascinating viewpoint of the future in Epic. Thanks for the link.

Malach, What you say makes sense. Acquiring open source talent gives
a company an inexpensive way of influencing and anticipating the
direction an open source project will go. It probably gives more bang
for the buck than acquiring a private company and having to handle the
inevitable culture clashes and process mis-matches.
