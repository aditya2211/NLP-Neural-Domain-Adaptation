Let me join the chorus of annoyance over Google's new toolbar ,
which, as noted in the linked article, commits just about every sin an
online marketer could commit, and makes up a few new ones besides. I'm
not fond of the Google-hates-privacy argument (You don't need to use
their site, you can opt-out of sharing your information, you don't need
to send stuff to anyone with a Gmail account, and if -- wonder of
wonders -- you're worried that you might send something to someone who
would forward an excerpt to someone who would then store it on a Gmail
account... you have far, far too much time on your hands). However, this
toolbar is really bad news.

On the other hand, it looks pretty cool.
