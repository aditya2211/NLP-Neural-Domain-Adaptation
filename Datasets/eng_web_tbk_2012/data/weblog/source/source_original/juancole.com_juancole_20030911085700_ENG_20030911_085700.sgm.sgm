What do the new al-Qaeda videotape and audio speeches of Bin Laden
and Ayman al-Zawahiri tell us about the hopes of the remaining top
leadership of the organization? Because the US and Pakistan have managed
to capture or kill about 2/3s of the top 25 al-Qaeda commanders, the
middle managers are not in close contact with al-Zawahiri and Bin Laden.
The tape was a way to signal priorities.

These are

1) Assassinate or overthrow Gen. Pervez Musharraf, the Pakistani
military "president" who had made a coup in 1999 and has thrown in his
lot with the United States against the Taliban and al-Qaeda. Musharraf
has been trying to purge his officer corps of the substantial number of
al-Qaeda sympathizers. His military intelligence has captured major
figures like Abu Zubayda and Khalid Shaykh Muhammad, as well as nearly
500 other al-Qaeda operatives, over 400 of whom the Pakistanis have
turned over to the US. Musharraf held elections in October of 2002, in
which center-right parties did well, but in which nearly 20 percent of
parliament seats went to the fundamentalist religious party coalition,
MMA. MMA also captured the Northwest Frontier Province, which probably
shelters Bin Laden and al-Zawahiri, and is in a joint government of
Baluchistan Province, also on the Afghanistan border. If al-Qaeda can
kill Musharraf or instigate a military coup against him by Islamist
junior officers, they can hope to catapult the MMA to power as political
allies and hosts. They would thereby gain control of a major base for
terrorist operations, which is also a nuclear power. All this is highly
unlikely, as with most al-Qaeda crackpot schemes. But so was it unlikely
that a small group of Arab mujahidin would virtually take over
Afghanistan.

Response: The US must do whatever it can to strengthen the legitimacy
of the Pakistani government. On the one hand, it should pressure
Musharraf to take off his uniform and run for president in a fair
election, and to repeal the contentious "Legal Framework Order" that
essentially perpetuates his dictatorship. On the other, restrictions
should be lifted on the mainstream Muslim League-N and Pakistan People's
Party, who can defeat the MMA in fair elections if not hogtied by the
secret police.

On the other hand, the US should strong-arm India and Pakistan into a
final settlement of the Kashmir issue. Al-Zawahiri attempted to use
Musharraf's lack of progress in helping the Muslims of that Indian state
as a justification for his overthrow. The Kashmir issue generates far
more terrorism, and even the threat of nuclear war, than Iraq ever did.

2) Target Israel and encourage the worst elements of the Palestinians
by playing on the iron fist policies of the Sharon government.

Response: The US has succeeded in politically isolating Hamas, and
started the process of cutting off its funding. This terrorist
organization can now only pull off far less sophisticated bombings and
attacks. It should continue to be defanged. But Sharon's iron fist is
simply not working as a means of establishing general peace, and the
Bush administration will have to finally apply effective pressure on
Sharon to stop his outrages in and colonization of the West Bank and
Gaza. Sharon's hard line has worked in tandem with Hamas's terrorism to
ratchet up tensions further and further, which spill over into the
Muslim world and serve as a recruiting tool for al-Qaeda in its search
for agents willing to hit the United States. Israel owes the United
States at least this much, in this crisis, to cease militarily
unnecessary provocations and establish genuine peace.

3) Make Iraq another Afghanistan, using the Republican Right's own
tactics against them.

Response: Iraq is actually hostile territory for al-Qaeda, and
without Iraqi sympathizers it cannot succeed there. By moving quickly to
Iraqi sovereignty and improvement of Iraqi lives, the US may be able to
get Iraqis on its side, so that they turn in the foreigners. Certainly,
the Shiites already hate al-Qaeda and would help; likewise the Kurds.
The problem of mollifying the Sunnis, though, has to be solved to avoid
giving al-Qaeda an entr√©e. The Americans have to put away their
free-market fetishism for a while and find ways of creating jobs and
pumping money into Iraqi households. We need an FDR in Iraq, not a
Ronald Reagan. Of course, the sooner the US soldiers can be withdrawn in
favor of less-provocative local or international forces, the better.
Getting the Spanish out of Iraq isn't nearly as good a rallying cry for
al-Qaeda in the Arab world as getting the Americans and British out.

The thing to keep in mind is that Sunni Arab nationalists and
Baathists and local Sunni radicals are likely to remain far more
dangerous to the US in Iraq than al-Qaeda infiltrators, and it would be
dangerous to take one's eyes off the former ball.
