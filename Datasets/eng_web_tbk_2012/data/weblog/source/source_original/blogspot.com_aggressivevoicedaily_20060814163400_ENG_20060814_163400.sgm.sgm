Remember when a whole lot of people had to die because a Swedish
newspaper printed those cartoons of the Prophet Mohammed? Now Iran wants
to turn the tables and is inviting cartoonists to do their best by
depicting the Holocaust. Amazingly, these idiots think a cartoon of
Mohammed is comparable to what we can expect in this new fun contest:
TEHRAN (AFP) - An international contest of cartoons on the Holocaust
opened in Tehran in response to the publication in Western papers last
September of caricatures of the Prophet Mohammed.

"We staged this fair to explore the limits of freedom Westerners
believe in," Masoud Shojai, head of the country's "Iran Cartoon"
association and the fair organizer, said.

"They can freely write anything they like about our prophet, but if
one raises doubts about the Holocaust he is either fined or sent to
prison," he added.

"Though we do not deny that fact that Jews were killed in the (second
world) war, why should the Palestinians pay for it?" Shojai told the
opening ceremony of the month-long fair in Tehran's Palestine
Contemporary Art Museum.

He added that around 1,100 cartoons were submitted by participants
from more than 60 countries and that more than 200 are on show.

He said the top three cartoons will be announced on September 2, with
the winners being awarded prizes of 12,000, 8,000 and 5,000 dollars
respectively. This cute little stunt is only going to prove just how
fanatic the extremist Muslims are. When they saw a cartoon of their
prophet, people had to die. When their precious cartoons are released I
highly doubt it will look like the end of the world.
