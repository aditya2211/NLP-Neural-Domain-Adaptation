Tamils feel that the proposed defense agreement between India and Sri
Lanka would encourage Sinhala rulers to prepare for another war
abandoning the current peace process

But there are strong hints in the country that a new Indo-Sri Lanka
defense deal could be in the making. And this has already drawn protests
from the Tamil National Alliance (TNA) which was backed by the LTTE in
the April general elections held in Sri Lanka. Apart from the 1,200
Indian lives lost in 1987, the Indian peacekeeping force was immensely
unpopular not only in Tamil Nadu and the Jaffna peninsula but also among
the Sinhalese majority who considered it a violation of their country's
sovereignty.

India defensive over Sri Lanka

By Ranjit Devraj

NEW DELHI - While India is ready to enter into a "defense cooperation
agreement" with Sri Lanka, it is wary of being drawn into any military
involvement in the island nation's two decades-old civil war that has
seen violent strife between ethnic Tamils and the Sinhalese majority -
leaving over 60,000 dead on both sides.

And that explains the delay in the signing of a formal defense
agreement that was at the heart of Sri Lankan President Chandrika
Kumaratunga's four-day visit to India recently.

According to Professor S D Muni, South Asia expert at the Jawaharal
Nehru University, the two-year peace talks between Colombo and the
Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) are stalemated. For that reason,
he said, Kumaratunga's government was keen to beef up military
preparedness with Indian support.

"The Sri Lankan government does not want to initiate a conflict but
would be interested in deterring the LTTE from starting one. And the
Tigers look as if they are on the brink of launching another offensive,"
Muni told IPS.

Colombo held six rounds of talks with the Tigers between September
2002 and March 2003. But last April, the rebels abruptly pulled out of
negotiations demanding recognition, first, for the right to self-rule
before proceeding any further.

Kumaratunga's India tour preceded a three-day visit to Sri Lanka by
Norwegian Foreign Minister Jan Petersen in a new bid to revive the peace
talks that were supposed to follow a ceasefire that Oslo successfully
brokered in February 2002.

Petersen held discussions with both Kumaratunga and the reclusive
LTTE leader Velupillai Prabhakaran in the rebel stronghold of
Kilinochchi without success, and chief Tamil rebel negotiator Anton
Balasingham and Norwegian envoy Erik Solheim held closed-door talks at
the international airport late Saturday in an effort to keep the salvage
effort on track, diplomatic sources said. But they, too, failed.

Colombo, too, seems to be in an intractable position. According to
former Indian army general A S Kalkat, the difficulty for Kumaratunga's
government lay in the fact that the LTTE had become a de jure power in
the north and east of the island and was running every aspect of civil
administration in the areas within its control.

A veteran of India's military intervention in the Jaffna peninsula to
help implement the 1987 Indo-Sri Lanka Peace Accord - which ambitiously
provided for the disarming of the formidable LTTE - Kalkat said the new
defense deal would essentially be a reiteration of the older one minus
its military commitment.

Kalkat, who currently chairs the independent US-based International
Council on Conflict Resolution, said despite the failure of the Indian
army to disarm or even subdue the Tigers, India remained the only power
capable of influencing the course of the current peace talks.

"The Norwegians mean well but their role is limited to that of honest
broker and the LTTE is keenly aware that they do not have the power
[unlike India] to underwrite any arrangement," Kalkat told IPS in an
interview.

In 1987, the Tamil Tigers reluctantly accepted the peace accord under
Indian pressure. Under the accord, a new northeastern provincial council
was formed and the Indian army was deployed as peacekeepers in the north
and east.

However, differences between India and LTTE soon surfaced and led to
clashes between Tiger guerrillas and the Indian peace keeping force.
About 1,200 Indian soldiers were killed during this phase of the
conflict. India had to pull back its forces from Sri Lanka in 1989
following the election of Ranasinghe Premadasa, a strong critic of
Indian mediation.

Last June, an international initiative led by Japan to persuade the
LTTE to come back to the negotiating table failed despite an aid package
offer of US$4.5 billion. Japan's special envoy, Yasushi Akashi, who
called for tangible progress in the peace process before the money would
be released, came back from visits to Colombo and Kilinochchi in early
November a frustrated man. He complained about the "visible lack of
progress" and reaching an impasse in talks with both sides.

The Tigers' chief ideologue, Balasingham, sniffed at the proposal
saying that "a solution to the ethnic conflict cannot be predetermined
by the resolutions or declarations of donor conferences, but has to be
negotiated by the parties in conflict without the constraints of
external forces."

But there are strong hints in the country that a new Indo-Sri Lanka
defense deal could be in the making. And this has already drawn protests
from the Tamil National Alliance (TNA) which was backed by the LTTE in
the April general elections held in Sri Lanka.

"Tamils feel that the proposed defense agreement between India and
Sri Lanka would encourage Sinhala rulers to prepare for another war
abandoning the current peace process," TNA member of parliament P
Sithamparanathan was quoted as saying in a statement. She added that
recent visits to the island by India's top military brass including army
chief General Nirmal Chander Vij have "caused apprehension among Tamils
that preparations are under way for another war in the island".

But Kalkat pointed out that India would be ill-advised to be involved
again, militarily, with Sri Lanka if only because it still had to
consider the sentiments of 45 million ethnic Tamils in the Indian state
of Tamil Nadu - separated from Sri Lanka's Jaffna peninsula by the
narrow Palk Straits.

Apart from the 1,200 Indian lives lost in 1987, the Indian
peacekeeping force was immensely unpopular not only in Tamil Nadu and
the Jaffna peninsula but also among the Sinhalese majority who
considered it a violation of their country's sovereignty.

The best option, now, under the present difficult circumstances is
for Colombo to do its own dirty work, although New Delhi can always be
counted on to render good neighborly help because of the shared belief
that religion, ethnicity and language cannot be the basis for secession.
In any case, Kalkat puts it succinctly: "There cannot be a military
option to what is a political situation."
