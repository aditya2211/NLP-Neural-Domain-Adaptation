Subject: IMMEDIATE ATTENTION NEEDED:
HIGHLY CONFIDENTIAL URGENT ASSISTANCE - FROM USA

FROM: GEORGE WALKER BUSH
202.456.1414 /
202.456.1111 FAX: 202.456.2461

Dear Sir / Madam,

I am GEORGE WALKER BUSH, son of the former president of the
United States of America George Herbert Walker Bush, and
currently serving as President of the United States of America.
This letter might surprise you because we have not met neither in
person nor by correspondence. I came to know of you in my search
for a reliable and reputable person to handle a very confidential
business transaction, which involves the transfer of a huge sum
of money to an account requiring maximum confidence.

I am writing you in absolute confidence primarily to seek your
assistance in acquiring oil funds that are presently trapped in
the republic of Iraq. My partners and I solicit your assistance
in completing a transaction begun by my father, who has long been
actively engaged in the extraction of petroleum in the United
States of America, and bravely served his country as director of
the United States Central Intelligence Agency.

In the decade of the nineteen-eighties, my father, then
vice-president of the United States of America, sought to work
with the good offices of the President of the Republic of Iraq to
regain lost oil revenue sources in the neighboring Islamic
republic of Iran. This unsuccessful venture was soon followed by
a falling-out with his Iraqi partner, who sought to acquire
additional oil revenue sources in the neighboring emirate of
Kuwait, a wholly-owned U.S.-British subsidiary.

My father re-secured the petroleum assets of Kuwait in 1991 at a
cost of sixty-one billion U.S. dollars ($61,000,000,000). Out of
that cost, thirty-six billion dollars ($36,000,000,000) were
supplied by King Hussein, Kingdom of Saudi Arabia and other
Persian Gulf monarchies, and sixteen billion dollars
($16,000,000,000) by German and Japanese partners. But my
father's former Iraqi business partner remained in control of the
republic of Iraq and its petroleum reserves.

My family is calling for your urgent assistance in funding the
removal of the President of the Republic of Iraq and acquiring
the petroleum assets of his country, as compensation for the
costs of removing him from power. Unfortunately, our partners
from 1991 are not willing to shoulder the burden of this new
venture, which in its upcoming phase may cost the sum of 100
billion to 200 billion dollars ($100,000,000,000 -
$200,000,000,000), both in the initial acquisition and in
long-term management.

Without the funds from our 1991 partners, we would not be able to
acquire the oil revenue trapped within Iraq. That is why my
family and our colleagues are urgently seeking your gracious
assistance. Our distinguished colleagues in this business
transaction include the sitting vice-president of the United
States of America, Richard Cheney, who is an original partner in
the Iraq venture and former head of the Halliburton oil company,
and Condoleeza Rice, whose professional dedication to the venture
was demonstrated in the naming of a Chevron oil tanker after her.

I would beseech you to transfer a sum equaling ten to twenty-five
percent(10-25 %) of your yearly income to our account to aid in
this important venture. The Internal Revenue Service of the
United States of America will function as our trusted
intermediary. I propose that you make this transfer before the
fifteenth (15th) of the month of April.

I know that a transaction of this magnitude would make anyone
apprehensive and worried. But I am assuring you that all will be
well at the end of the day. A bold step taken shall not be
regretted, I assure you. Please do be informed that this business
transaction is 100% legal. If you do not wish to co-operate in
this transaction, please contact our intermediary representatives
to further discuss the matter.

I pray that you understand our plight. My family and our
colleagues will be forever grateful. Please reply in strict
confidence to the contact numbers below.

Sincerely with warm regards,

George Walker Bush
