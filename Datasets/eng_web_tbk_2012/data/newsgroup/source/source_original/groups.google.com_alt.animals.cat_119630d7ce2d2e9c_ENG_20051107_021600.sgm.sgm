Like you said &quot;the kids egg him on&quot;. maybe too much . Sounds like your cat
is stressed out . Maybe he doesn't want to play when they want to.. He
didn't take a dislike to the kids for &quot;no&quot; reason! cats react to the
treatment they receive, they are not toys. maybe the cat needs a &quot;new'
home.........Julie
