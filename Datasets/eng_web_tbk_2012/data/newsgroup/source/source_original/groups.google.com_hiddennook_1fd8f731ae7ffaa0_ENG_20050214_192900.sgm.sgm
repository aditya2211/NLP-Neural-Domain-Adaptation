Wiki Media Foundation, the group behind the Wikipedia online encyclopedia project, said Friday that search giant Google has volunteered to host some of its content on company servers.
(ZD Net) It looks like the war between  Microsoft and Google is quickly brewing  on the horizon. Microsoft is 4-0 (they took down Netscape, Suns Systems, MAC and IBM) and Google may be their next target. Google is probably making this move to counter Microsoft Search using Encarta (it's online dictionary). More below.

But it looks like Google isn't opening it's mouth about the reason behind the offer as  Linux News  reports:
"While we don't have anything specific to announce today, Google and the Wikimedia Foundation are collaboratively evaluating creative ways to support Wikipedia.org and its community."
Sure Google, although this would put it on coarse for  global domination of the internet  by 2014. It will be interesting to see whether or not Google will finally slay the Microsoft Goliath, who has known no major defeat and seeks to vanquish all competition. Selah!
