Heh,
yep, I like to wear silk chemises, panties even stockings with garter
belt.
I feel great in it. First time I started wearing woman's lingerie I was
very young. I didn't fought is it good or not than. Later on I red
somewhere that it's seakness. I was ashamed to be in friendship with
girls ... until I undrstood that it's not seakness as well as women
wearing men's pants isn't seak :) Now I have wife and son. My wife know
my harmless secret and supports me.
So, I'm Men and love to wear women's lingerie :-).

There nothing wrong with men dressing in lingerie, when I get home at
night the first thing I do is change into a nice silky nightgown or
nightie, love the feel.
