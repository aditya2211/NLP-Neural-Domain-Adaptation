Hello there

Action Network is a BBC website for people who are taking action on
issues that concern them. I'm getting in touch because I think it could
be useful to people campaigning about hospital closures. We've got a
page dedicated to issues around hospitals
( http://www.bbc.co.uk/dna/actionnetwork/C55153 ) and a group called NHS
SOS have already put up a campaign about ward closures in Cumbria.

I'm hoping to build this up to be a hub for all the campaigners - a
place where people can exchange ideas and advice.

It would be great if the person from CHANT who started this page would
put up a short description of the campaign and a list to this group
page on the Action Network site.

Action Network is also a good place to post details of events, or try
to rally together a group if you want to take action in your area. You
can attach anything you write to pages for your local area, as well as
to the 'issue' pages.

I'm more than happy to help people with the site or answer any
questions about Action Network - just drop me a message. Otherwise,
hope to see you there!

Kind regards
Ruth Penycate
