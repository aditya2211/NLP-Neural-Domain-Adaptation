Wei's Magic Cubes

Wei Ligang, a rising star of modern art in China, just had an
exhibition in mid-July, 2005 in Hong Kong. He is now lecturing in USA.
His art perfectly combines painting and Chinese calligraphy. He is
regarded as one of the leading Avant-Garde artist of modern
calligraphy.

His artworks were selected and exhibited in British Museum in 2002.
&quot;Wei has given some virtuoso performances with brush and ink, often
incorporating several different techniques into a single work,&quot; said
Gordon S. Barrass, curator of the exhibition.

In the world of &quot;Wei's magic cubes,&quot; all seem to be ingeniously
planned and tricky. All are mathematical, all are linguistic. In
Wei's art, a logician could see mathematical logic, a cellist could
see a ripple of nine bass notes, a country girl could see straw, and
Harry Potter could see two accompanied green blazes.

&quot;...to gaze at Wei's art is like entering a floating world of
dreams.&quot; --- The Art of Calligraphy in Modern China (British Museum
Press, 2002)
