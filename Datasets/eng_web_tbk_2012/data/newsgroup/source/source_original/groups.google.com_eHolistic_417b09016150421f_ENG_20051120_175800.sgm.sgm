One Simple Idea. One Huge Opportunity.
What are you searching for? More personal freedom? More time with your
family? Independent wealth? Freedom from the fear of corporate
downsizing? Whether you are looking for a part-time income to help pay
off your debts or you are looking for the freedom offered by working
from home on a full time basis, Agel is the vehicle that can make that
happen.

Agel is a new company and is uniquely positioned to be the next giant
in the network marketing industry. The company has developed an
entirely new category of products. Imagine being part of the next
industry-changing innovation.

Innovative Products

Agel introduces an entirely new category of products called
Gelceuticals. The company has developed a unique and innovative
delivery mechanism for nutritional products. This proprietary Gel
Suspension technology makes possible single serving packets of
Gelceuticals.

In this delivery format, your body can immediately start receiving the
benefits of the product components as the absorption of vitamins,
minerals and nutrients is maximized.

Never before has such a convenient method been available for consuming
nutritional products. Consider these convenience factors:

No water needed (as with tablets or capsules)

Exotic juice benefits without the big bottle (no glass and water
weight)

Single serving packages (imagine the sampling capabilities)

Perfect for those with difficulty swallowing tablets or capsules

Faster, more efficient, delivery to the body Learn More

Revolutionary Compensation

Agel has created a new compensation structure that is truly
revolutionary. It is our belief that this compensation plan will
produce some of the largest checks in network marketing history. The
plan can't be described as a binary, a breakaway, a unilevel, or a
forced matrix. It is a revolutionary hybrid.

What is long term viability? It is not just company longevity. If you
used to make $100k and now only make $30k, this is not long term
viability. Ten years later your check should still be the same or
greater, fulfilling the promise of long-term residual income. The Agel
compensation plan includes the principles that ensure that promise can
be fulfilled for those who work at it.
