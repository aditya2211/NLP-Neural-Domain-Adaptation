Visualizations as a helpful beginning technique
-----------------------------------------------

If you consider that you still need the assistance of other
visualizations to help the mind feel the spirit of transcendence, try
the following before moving onto the more formal method below.
Visualisations can be as useful tools, but meditation is more than
that. Meditation has to do with what is called ideation. It is always
good to stick to a formal intense meditation practice like the one for
beginners described in the MP3 file that follows after the
visualisations.

Find a comfortable place on the floor and sit with your legs crossed.
Place your hands one on top of the other in your lap, keep your back
straight, eyes closed and tongue on the roof of your mouth. Your
breathing should be calm and relaxed, through the nose. Spend a minute
or so concentrating on your breath, feeling the air flowing through
your nostrils.

1. Warm Sun Visualization

Continue to breathe slowly and deeply. With each breath, feel the
muscles in your body becoming lighter and lighter, and also your
external motor and sensory organs are feeling like they are withdrawing
from the world into a special inner quietness. Imagine the tension
melting away as you continue breathing rhythmically and naturally.
Picture yourself sitting on a warm, tropical beach basking in the glow
of the sun ... . Visualize the vivid, beautiful colours of the earth
(its flowers and plants), the sea next to you, and the sky above you.
Feel yourself floating above the earth and sea. As you sit above the
world, the warmth of the golden sun penetrates your body and makes you
feel warmer and warmer. It surrounds you. The golden rays feel soft
and soothing. Now you are far above the earth - into space.
Everything around you is so vast. Yet, there is warmth and a
familiarity with the vastness. You want to merge your mind with the
greater universal Mind that surrounds you.

Continue to ideate on this intense desire for your mind to merge with
the that universal Consciousness. And while doing so continue using the
Baba Nam Kevalam mantra (breathe in with Baba Nam, breathe out with
Kevalam). Try this for 5 to 10 minutes.

Now come back to earth again - slowly. Imagine yourself sitting on the
beach serenely and restfully. Your muscles are loose and limp. Feel
your body sinking slightly into the sand making that earthly connection
again. The sun's rays and warmth are still with you, surrounding you.
You are in a state of peace and relaxation. With each breath, watch
your body and ensure that it remains relaxed - at peace.

Continue to feel the warmth of the sunlight all over your body, warming
you deeply and gently. You want to bring something back with you from
your deep space experience where you sensed your mind merging with the
universal Mind. This will be the warmth of the sun - a close reminder
and link between earth and the infinite space. Visualize the inside of
your body bathed in the golden light, absorbing every ray and glowing
as radiantly as the sun. A warm, gentle breeze swirls around your body
and relaxes you even more .Let your mind and body be totally at peace.

Now feel yourself returning to where you sit ... move your hands and
feet a little, stretch them. Open your eyes.

2. Mountain Visualization

Another thing you can try.

Imagine you're sitting on top of a mountain, and that it's the most
peaceful place you can think of. Feel that you're sitting there in
complete peace, right on top of the world. Now imagine that infinite
happiness is surrounding you in every direction. Feel you're completely
surrounded by that infinite peace and happiness. Now start to repeat
within your mind the mantra: BABA NAM KEVALAM. Its meaning is &quot;Infinite
happiness is everywhere&quot;.

Feel the meaning, don't just think of its wordy meaning or try to
translate from Sanskrit (BABA NAM KEVALAM) to an English meaning
(Infinite peace and happiness). Think internally, intuitively, not by
words, of the meaning, as you're repeating it. This is called
ideation. It is important to take the idea, not just the intellectual
analysis. Touching deep into the idea is what builds intuition - it is
a synthetic process. Whereas, trying to translate and grapple with
wordy meanings is an intellectual mechanism - an analytical process.

Feel you're surrounded by infinite peace and happiness, and feel that
your own sense of existence is in direct contact with that endless
peace and happiness all around you. You can go further and feel that
your unit consciousness, a dot in the Infinite Consciousness, is
merging with Infinity. Continue for as long as you like, then open
your eyes.

OK that is fairly basic :). The important point is to develop some
psycho-spiritual connection between your mind and the universal
Consciousness or Supreme Consciousness.

Don't worry if you have trouble concentrating on the mantra and
ideation - that's normal. It takes some time and practice to be able to
focus on the one thought. The main thing is to keep practicing. If you
don't practice, then nothing happens. Well maybe a miracle could
happen, but lets face it we're ordinary people and so require practical
day to day techniques!
