NORTH CAROLINA RELIGIOUS COALITION FOR MARRIAGE EQUALITY

From what we hear from the news media, one could easily conclude that
all Christians are opposed to gay marriage. But that’s not the case.
Last year an organization named the North Carolina Religious Coalition
for Marriage Equality was formed to get out the message that at least
some people of faith are not opposed to extending the rights and
responsibilities of civil marriage to same-gender couples.

One of “NCRC4ME’s” major efforts is to collect signatures for the
attached “Declaration of Religious Leaders,” which has been and will
again be presented to members of the NC legislature. It presents the
case for marriage equality and states, “We are resolved that the State
should not interfere with same-gender couples who choose to marry and
share fully and equally in the rights, responsibilities, and commitments
of civil marriage.”

A measure to amend the NC Constitution to ban gay marriage was defeated
last year but already has been reintroduced in the 2005 legislative
session, so there is a real need for visible support for the
“pro-same-gender-marriage” side of this issue.

At its February meeting the CHS Vestry voted unanimously to add their
names to the Declaration. Our Rector Barbara and our Deacon Clare also
have signed the Declaration. Furthermore, the Vestry voted unanimously
to invite the support of members of the CHS congregation for the
Declaration. (Since the Declaration is written as coming from
“religious leaders,” people who don’t consider themselves “religious
leaders” can sign as “Supporters of the North Carolina Religious
Coalition for Marriage Equality.”) Please note that the Declaration
addresses only civil marriage; it says nothing about religious beliefs
or practices regarding marriage.

If you have any questions please feel free to call me (after Sat. the
26th, when I will return from a trip). Sign-up lists will be available
at the services on Feb. 27 and March 6, or you can email me. I will
email names and email addresses (or postal addresses) of signers to
NCRC4ME in time for their “lobby day” in Raleigh on March 15.

Thank you for your consideration of this issue.

North Carolina Religious Coalition for Marriage Equality
Declaration of Religious Leaders
April 19, 2004

The most fundamental human right, after the necessities of food,
clothing and shelter, is the right to affection and the supportive love
of other human beings. We become most fully human when we love another
person. We can grow in our capacity to be human - to be loving - in a
family unit. This right to love and form a family is so fundamental that
our United States Constitution takes it for granted in its dedication to
&quot;secure the blessings of liberty to ourselves and our posterity.” The
North Carolina Constitution likewise affirms the “inalienable rights” of
human beings to &quot;life, liberty, the enjoyment of the fruits of their own
labor, and the pursuit of happiness.&quot;

Throughout history, tyrants have known that by denying the right of
oppressed peoples to form and nurture families, they can kill the spirit
of those peoples. &gt;From the shameful history of slavery in America, the
injustice of forbidding people to marry is evident as a denial of a
basic human right. The American laws forbidding interracial marriage,
now struck down, were clearly discriminatory. Denial of the status of
marriage to those who would freely accept its responsibilities creates
legal and economic inequities and social injustice. We feel called to
protest and oppose this injustice.

As religious people, clergy and lay leaders, we are mandated by faith to
stand for justice in our common civic life. We oppose the use of sacred
texts and religious traditions to deny legal equity to same-gender
couples. As concerned citizens we affirm the liberty of adults of the
same gender to love and marry. We insist that no one, especially the
state, is allowed to coerce people into marriage or bar two consenting
adults, whether of the same or differing genders, from forming the
family unit that lets them be more fully loving, thus more fully human.
We respect the fact that debate and discussion continue in many of our
religious communities as to the scriptural, theological and liturgical
issues involved. However, we draw on our many faith traditions to arrive
at a common conviction. We are resolved that the State should not
interfere with same-gender couples who choose to marry and share fully
and equally in the rights, responsibilities, and commitments of civil
marriage.

We affirm freedom of conscience in this matter. We recognize that the
state may not require religious groups to officiate at, or bless,
same-gender marriages. Likewise, a denial of state civil recognition
dishonors the religious convictions of those communities and clergy who
officiate at, and bless, same-gender marriages. The state may not favor
the convictions of one religious group over another by denying
individuals their fundamental right to marry and to have those marriages
recognized by civil law.

As faith leaders, we commit ourselves to public action, visibility,
education, and mutual support in the service of the right and freedom to
marry.
