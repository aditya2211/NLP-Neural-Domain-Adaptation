MAKE THOUSANDS!!! -- THIS IS NOT A SCAM!!!

I found this on a bulletin board and decided to try it: I don't care
about the useless pre-fabricated crap this message usually says. All I
say is, it works. Continue pre-fab crap.

WELL GUESS WHAT!!!

Within seven days, I started getting money in the mail!! I
was shocked!! I figured it would end soon, but the money just kept
coming in. In my first week, I made about $25.00. By the end of the
second week I had
made a total of more than $1000.00!! In the third week I had more than
$10,000.00 and it's still growing!! This is now my fourth week and I
have made a total of $42,000.00 and it's still coming rapidly. It's
certainly worth $6.00 and six stamps, and I have spent more than that
on the lottery without ever winning!!!

Let me tell you how this works and most important, why it
works..........
also make sure you print this out NOW, so you can get the information
off of it, as you will need it. I promise you that if you follow the
directions exactly that you
will start making more money than you thought possible by doing
something so easy!!

Suggestion: Read this entire message carefully!! (Print it out or
download it)

Follow the simple directions and watch the money come in!! It's easy.
It's legal. And, your investment is only $6.00 (Plus postage) !!!

IMPORTANT:

This is not a rip-off, it is decent; it's legal; and it is virtually
no risk - it really works!! If all the following instructions are
adhered to, you will receive extraordinary dividends.

PLEASE NOTE:

Please follow the directions EXACTLY, and $50,000 or more can be yours
in 20 to 60 days. This program remains successful because of the
honesty and
integrity of the participants. Please continue its success by
carefully adhering to
the instructions. You will now become apart of the Mail Order
business. You
are in the business of developing Mailing Lists. Many large
corporations are
happy to pay big bucks for quality lists. However, the money made from
the
mailing lists is secondary to income which is made from people like
you and me asking to be included in that list. Here are the four easy
steps to success.

STEP ONE:

Get six separate pieces of paper and write the following on
each piece of paper &quot;PLEASE PUT ME ON YOUR MAILING LIST.&quot;
Now get 6 U.S. $1.00 bills and place ONE inside of EACH of the six
pieces of paper so the bill will not be seen through the envelope (to
prevent thievery). Next, place one paper in each of the six envelopes
and seal them. You now should have six sealed envelopes, each with a
piece of paper stating the above phrase, your name and address, and a
$1.00 bill. What you are doing is creating a service.

THIS IS ABSOLUTELY LEGAL!!!!!

You are requesting a legitimate service and you are paying for it!!
Like
most of us I was a little skeptical and little worried about the legal
aspects
of it all. So I checked it out with the U.S. Post Office
(1-800-238-5355) and they
confirmed that it is indeed legal!!

Mail the six envelopes to the following addresses:

1) G. Burrows
1/264 Tor St
Toowoomba QLD
4350 Australia

2)S Luest
P.O. Box 366
Garden Grove, CA 92842
USA

3) G.V. &amp; A. Bourret
41 Broome St, #1
Brooklyn, NY 11222
USA

4)R. Ansems
Gen. Foulkesstraat 5
4641 BW Ossendrecht
Netherlands

5)W. Brumbley
4632 Hilton Ave
Suite # 31
Columbus, Ohio 43228

STEP TWO:Now take the #1 name off the list that you see above, move
the other names up (six becomes 5, 5 becomes 4, and etc.) and add YOUR
NAME as number 6 on the list.

STEP THREE:
Change anything you need to but try to keep this article as close to
original as possible. Now post your amended article to at least 200
news groups. :
(I think there are close to 24,000 groups) All you need is 200, but
remember, the more you post, the more money you make!! This is
perfectly legal!! If you have any doubts, refer to Title 18 Sec. 1302
&amp; 1341 of the Postal Lottery laws. Keep a copy of these steps for
yourself and whenever you need money, you can use it again, and again.
PLEASE REMEMBER that this program remains successful because of the
honesty and integrity of the participants and by their carefully
adhering to directions. Look at it this way. If you were of integrity,
the program will continue and the money that so many others have
received will come your way.

NOTE: You may want to retain every name and address sent to you,
either on a computer or hard copy and keep the notes people send you.
This VERIFIES that you are truly providing a service. (Also, it might
be a good idea to wrap the $1 bill in dark paper to reduce the risk of
mail theft). So, as each post is downloaded and the directions
carefully followed, all members will be reimbursed for their
participation as a List Developer with one dollar each. Your name
will move up the list geometrically so that when your name reaches the
#1 position you will be receiving thousands of dollars in CASH!!! What
an opportunity for only $6.00 ( $1.00 for each of the first six people
listed above) Send it now, add your own name to the list and you're in
business!!!
