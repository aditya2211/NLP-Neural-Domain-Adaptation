How has Katrina changed the US?

What will be the lasting effects of Hurricane Katrina and what can be
learnt from the response?

Relief agencies are trying to help hundreds of thousands of displaced
people while authorities have vowed to restore security in New Orleans
following a breakdown of law and order.

In the world press, commentators predict that Katrina will make a
profound change in the way the US is perceived at home and abroad,
especially following the scenes of poverty and racial divisions they
believe the disaster has revealed.

Meanwhile, President George W Bush has said he will lead an inquiry
into how the disaster was handled.

disaster affected the way other countries view the US? Send us your

Some of the better comments:

&quot;As an American, I would like to take this opportunity to tell all the
'USA and Bush Bashers' that I am appalled at the number of 'allies'
that are using this disaster as their podium to spread their useless
opinions. What you see in New Orleans is a perfect example of the
downfalls of the welfare system, a form of socialism that many in this
country know is the true problem. You have seen the pictures. You
people think it is race, but it is not. It is the welfare society that
was New Orleans.&quot; --Paul, Atlanta, USA

&quot;I am frankly revolted by the response of the Bush-Bashers; &quot;Sorry
chaps, but you did have it coming...&quot; The plain fact is that Bush has a
sight more in the way of common humanity than a great many of his
detractors. At least he isn't using this disaster for cheap political
point-scoring.&quot; --Mac, Nottingham

&quot;I do not feel it has changed the US citizens which is what was needed,
even now the majority want &quot;Gas&quot; despite the fact they are polluting
the world more than any other country in the world and refuse to stop,
perhaps this natural disaster, which let's face it looks like a product
of Global Warming, will change their views, why not pick things up with
your hands and walk with your legs, other people in the world do it,
&quot;Gas&quot; is not the be all and end all!&quot; --David, Kent

&lt;This man has clearly never visited the US. Distances are not what
they are in the old world. Here, cars are absolutely necessary, and
he'd have to have one, too. -Juggernaut&gt;

&quot;The US will work its way through the loss of a city and we are making
progress after seven short days. Thank you for your concern, but Europe
is still irrelevant.&quot; --John B, Windermere, Florida

&lt;John can come over to eat at my house anytime. -Juggernaut&gt;

It is always interesting what spin the press will take. Certainly,
representation of the US in other countries will have a certain
depiction. I don't believe that folks who believe that America is the
land of opportunity will change their views from this recent news. I
have a friend who came here from Bulgaria after winning a green card in
a lottery. Yes, she and her family were delighted to leave the
communistic remnants in that country. Her husband became a citizen of
the US just the week before last. (Believe it or not, it takes a
minimum of 5 years to apply.)

The countries which are giving to America to aid are a great example of
the seed that America has sown through the years with other nations.

Now to the poverty stricken and the racial issue... You know, I've
lived in the Dallas/Fort Worth Metroplex most of my life. When not in
Texas, I lived in LA and San Francisco. There is a lot of racial
diversity in all of these places... and I've vacationed through the
south... visited my folks when they lived in Mississippi, and where
they live now and are in the racial minority being white (less than
20%) in northeastern Arkansas. The fact is, when I began traveling for
business to New England, when I first visited my in-laws in Montana and
Idaho, I was shocked at the lack of racial diversity. I didn't expect
to react that way, but when I was looking around my workplace in
Nashua, New Hampshire, and everyone else looked pretty much like me, it
was really very eerie.

So, yes, America has pockets that are more diverse than others.
Additionally, reviewing the standings of Louisiana and Mississippi in
the educational stakes, you'll find they usually land near the bottom
of a list of 50 states.

Unfortunately, those left behind to be filmed, where those without
transportation or means. Some refused to leave, but so many were
unable to.

Yes, it's a valid reflection of America - we do have cities like this.
However, New Orleans also had many affluent people, people who left
town early as they had the means.

I don't know if this will change other nation's perceptions of America.
I suspect it will not change greatly... but you never know how much
stock people put in the news.

I do know that this will change the face of America. I expect that
many of the displaced people (those affluent and those not) will remain
in the places they were evacuated to. The 1.25 million people who have
been housed in stadiums and convention centers across Texas will begin
to populate Houston, Dallas, San Antonio and Galveston, and the
surrounding areas. Sure, some will return, but I have a feeling that
once many begin to get jobs and temporary housing, they may be shy
about returning.

I'm interested in what America will look like in 5 years. Will racial
diversity find its way to Wyoming as some people are offered jobs
there? Or will the nearly year-round snow be too much for those who
have never experienced snow in their lives? Will the housing market in
Dallas begin booming like the rest of the nation has due to the influx
of buyers? Will businesses that were new in 2005 have become a
household name due to their efforts in rebuilding the gulf coast? What
will the federal government do to prevent inflation in the housing and
building market?

These are some of the things I've been wondering...

Okay, I'm new to this forum and really don't like Bush, so my view
point is slanted and I admit that. I rarely listen to the news or to
what politicians or lawyers say because so many tell lies that none
have credibility so what's the point? What I know is that I have a
close friend who's aunt disappeared in New Orleans. My friend didn't
have computer capability, so I spent the day searching and posting
online. The family here (California) wanted to fly any family members
from there to CA, so they could remain here until things got
straightened out down there. The cousins could not be found because
no one was sure of their married names. The hope was that anyone
looking for the Aunt would see the family post and know that help was
available. It is Oct. 6, and not one family member has been located.
What I saw was dozens of school buses submerged that could have been
used to evacuate people who had no transportation. What I heard was
the Mayor of New Orleans, saying that he didn't order the buses or
anything else to be used because he was waiting on someone else to tell
him what to do. When common sense takes a back seat to politics and
legal mumbo jumbo what have we become?

Recently, Bush addressed the nation. About 30 seconds into his
address, he started flogging the terrorist issue just one more time.
Ironically he almost burst out laughing and it was all he could do to
keep his mirth down to a barely controlled smirk. Even he can't
believe that he is trotting out this old saw again. I guess if you
have a schtick that is a resounding success once, you can't help but
trot it out every time your act is going sour. Meanwhile, every pocket
that can be lined is golden and the poor are shunted off radar yet
again.

The gall of it all is that Bush is stumping for more money to build
more refineries, when what he should do is pour money into making the
US independent of OPEC or crude oil all together. We have the
technology; if you are going to spend billions of dollars touting
&quot;FREEDOM&quot; why not spend those billions making all of us free? Free of
polution, free of oil dependency, and free of big business that is
bleeding us dry for the short term good (theirs).
I'm sorry he makes me want to puke so I shut him off. In the meanwhile
there are still broken families that should have been safe in the home
of the brave.
