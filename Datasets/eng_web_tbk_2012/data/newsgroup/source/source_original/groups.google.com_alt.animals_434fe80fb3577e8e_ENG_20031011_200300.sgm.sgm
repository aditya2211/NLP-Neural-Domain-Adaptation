The Rock revolution happened in the Sixties (6, number of the Beast).
It came from Liverpool, that was the port base to the Titanic,
destroyed by God because of the arrogant insult of captain Smith (also
from Liverpool): &quot;Not even God can sink my ship&quot; (not only the
captain, but also the rest of the crew and even the orchestra playing
at the Titanic were from Liverpool). The Rock revolution came from the
nation that allows a church to be changed to a pub or to a dance room
or to a recording studio full of drug addicts, homosexuals and
lunatics (as that of George Martin, ally of the Beatles).
It came from the nation whose king Enrique VIII adulterated the Bible
so that divorce could be allowed and in this way be able to give loose
rein to the many divorces from his wives and subsequent murdering of
the same ones and to whom God provided a wife with six fingers as
abomination (Anne Boleyn)...once again 6, number of the Beast....
It is interesting to observe that this nation is nicknamed &quot;the
Devil's Island&quot;. As the epithet of the government of Satan on that
nation, the center of London, the so well-known Piccadilly Circus,
takes it's name from an old brothel (the &quot;Piccadilla House&quot; which
means &quot;The House of Sin&quot;), disappeared nowadays.

The antichrist John Lennon, one of the Devil's main puppets to destroy
family, social and moral values and to begin the disintegration of
mankind, did hit Stuart Sutcliffe (the first bass player of the
Beatles) in the head with a club repeatedly in Hamburg. Some months
later Sutcliffe died from brain haemorrhage because of John Lennon's
bruises. John Lennon entered stardom being a murderer.
The same demons that made captain Smith say &quot;Not even God can sink my
ship&quot; spoke from antichrist John Lennon (from Liverpool, base port to
the Titanic) saying: &quot;Christianity is on the go. It will vanish and
shrink. We are more popular than Jesus and Pope&quot;....That was the day
that GOD'S CURSE fell upon the world of Rock.
One week after that declaration, ONLY ONE WEEK LATER, Brian Epstein,
forger of the Beatle farce, died from an overdose. From then on, the
Beatles began to get involved in false religions and to preach them to
the world.
John Lennon's divorce followed, as well as his entering the world of
black magic, as deeply as to buy the apartment. where the &quot;Rosemary's
baby&quot; had been filmed, previous property of Roman Polansky, and in
that same apartment John Lennon had a room upholstered with black silk
where he used to do his black magic operations.
Came the disintegration of the Beatles' minds with LSD which has
caused, among others, schizophrenic lyrics such as &quot;I am the Walrus&quot;
and incoherent schizophrenic musical expositions like &quot;Revolution
number 9&quot;.
At the same time, the devil acted through his other main puppets with
&quot;Sympathy for the devil&quot; that was when the pact of the Rolling Stones
with Satan took the life of the founder of the group, the guitarist
Brian Jones (who refused to be a puppet of the devil), murdered by
people sent by Mick Jagger, another assassin.
Antichrist John Lennon followed the Devil's strategy writing lyrics
such as &quot;God is a concept by which we measure our pain...I don't
believe in Jesus, etc., etc.,&quot; (God) and &quot;and no religions too...&quot;
(Imagine).
Antichrist John Lennon wanted to compete with Jesus Christ, and so he
grew a beard and started to make a bogus role of Christ together with
Yoko Ono at the Amsterdam Hilton hotel proclaiming &quot;Peace&quot;, being then
when he was visited by the Canadian journalist who ridiculized and
admonished him wanting to know about what Lennon meant when he wrote
in the lyrics of &quot;The ballad of John and Yoko&quot;: &quot;the way things are
going, they're going to crucify me...&quot;,
The CURSE OF GOD upon John Lennon carried on with all type of miseries
and distresses which made Lennon give the interview to the &quot;Rolling
Stone&quot; magazine (today condensed in the &quot;Lennon remembers&quot; book) where
he speaks about how bad thing were going for him blaming &quot;whatever is
up there&quot; for it (referring to God).
The CURSE OF GOD carried on until he was shot dead. It is interesting
to notice that he was shot seven times, being seven, as well as three,
the holy numbers in Holy Cabalah tradition....

After George Harrison, said arrogantly in a video filmed in his studio
at Henley on Thames: &quot;I want to talk about the divinity of man&quot;, he
was given throat cancer by GOD because of those words, which made
metastasis and carried on to final death..
To Paul McCartney whose company's logo was a person toying with the
planets as if he was a god, and who was being very much deluded in his
ego trip by the fact that he was made &quot;Sir&quot; (when in England even the
road sweeper is made Sir, as long as he produces money for the
nation), GOD provided cancer to the wife.
The advertising farce of how much he loved Linda (woman whose quality
he did not deserve), was exposed when it was known that Paul had an
affair with Heather Mills, Linda's intimate friend, with whom
McCartney went on a trip to New York and to whom he bought things and
presents, while he was still mourning for his &quot;dear Linda&quot;.
At the same time McCartney was going out with Heather Mills, he used
Linda's death for promotional ends, due to his waning popularity. Paul
was going out with Heather, but in front of the audience he played the
faithful husband's masquerade pretending to suffer for Linda, for the
afore mentioned promotional ends.
Paul admitted that he made Linda suffer a lot, but he didn't say that
it was because he felt insecure as a man due to his womanish face and
effeminate manners and also because with his age his sexual power was
not the same, even though it has never been much. The early days were
the days of competition between Paul and his wife and John and his
wife and he knew he had to compete with ugly John for the leadership
of the band in front of their wives and having Yoko Ono made him aware
of his lack of virility and repressed homosexuality, he grew the beard
that we see in the &quot;Let it Be&quot; film and started to show pictures of
naked women in the same film, doing every effort he could to be seen
as a man....
It is easy to note the uneasiness of McCartney when he sings: &quot;I've
got a feeling, a feeling I can't hide...&quot; in front of Yoko in the
film. (He already had the traumas that his previous girlfriend Jane
Asher had caused him when she made him aware of his little manliness
and effeminate manners).
Paul has such a big inferiority complex as a man, due to his
effeminate face, body and personality and due to his repressed
homosexuality, that he found himself a handicapped woman with only one
leg, so that he could stand out, being very conscious that a full
woman would make him feel the superiority of virile men again, as Jane
and Linda did. This is something that his ego trip of lucky bad
musician could not face anymore....He is very conscious that money and
fame cannot buy virility and manliness.

Besides being a murderer, John Lennon had sexual intercourse with
homosexual Brian Epstein to get him interested in going to see the
band at the Cavern, trauma from which he never recovered. Because of
the trauma that his homosexual relation with Brian Epstein had left
him, he made lyrics such as: &quot;You can wear a collar and a tie, one
thing you can't hide is when you're crippled inside&quot; and gave
declarations to the &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; magazine saying that &quot;sometimes he
wore Texan boots to feel more secure as a man&quot;.

The Beatles are very well known by people close to them for their
arrogance and racism. One of the manifestations of their racism is the
rejection towards Japanese Yoko Ono. That rejection got to the point
that George Harrison kicked Yoko Ono in the Apple studios during the
filming of Let it Be.
When John asked George while they were having lunch about how things
were going for Paul after his separation from the Beatles and George
replied that he was number one in the Swedish hit parade, John said in
a despective manner: &quot;ah!!.. in Sweden..&quot;, as if Sweden was an
inferior place or something alike.
In the Beatles' song &quot;Get Back&quot; they advise black Joe to &quot;get back to
where you once belonged&quot;, as if England was not a place for black
people.
Sometimes back, Paul told George in the Apple offices that the new
generations are a bundle of idiots and useless people, but in any way
they would have also been slaves of the Beatles.
The Jewish marriage living to the right of George's house said that he
is an arrogant person who does never return a greeting. The newly
married couple living on the corner in front of the entrance of
George's house (Friar Park) refers to him as an overbearing person to
stay away from. The receptionist of &quot;Hand made&quot;, the former film
making company of George Harrison said: &quot;we don't have any relation
with that man anymore and we don't want to know anything about him&quot;.
It is interesting to note that this company was made bankrupt by the
British cinema industry due to the despotism and pedantry of George
Harrison, who believed that the cinema industry would have worshiped
him.
Their chauvinisms got to the point that even they themselves hated
each other. Paul McCartney said that George Harrison is a nothing.
George Harrison said that he is tired of listening to people talk
about John Lennon....
George Harrison said in a video that &quot;Oasis is a very untalented band
and they shouldn't be playing at all&quot;, all of it being the truth, but
the Beatles is also a band of very poor musicians, if musicians at
all, who could only play a couple of elementary guitar chords and who
are as untalented as Oasis. The Beatles of the times of the &quot;Cavern&quot;
sounded exactly as poorly as Oasis and the little musical quality in
the songs of the Beatles is due to George Martin. Without George
Martin the Beatles would have been just another untalented band as
Oasis....

Paul McCartney said recently that he believes in using magic, and he
does lots of charity, thinking that in this way he will compensate for
the CURSE OF GOD that is upon him and that took his wife's life
because of his Satanism and involvement in black magic. He thinks he
will deceive people in this way, so that the real McCartney will not
be perceived. Is the old Devil attempting to disguise as good in front
of people. Satan deceiving mankind once again, as so many other
thousands of times through the centuries....

After the Devil began his devastating job from the ghostly &quot;Devil's
Island&quot; through his nine main puppets (Beatles-Rolling Stones), he
possessed an endless amount of other schizophrenic bad musician in the
afore mentioned Island and weakening their conscience with drugs, he
made them proclaimers of homosexuality, aversion to religion,
destruction of family values, dissipation, mental illness,
antisocialism, etc., etc.,
The fact that bad apprentice musicians such as the Beatles and the
Rolling Stones achieved such a giant fame that not even the real
quality musicians could achieve, was because the forces of Satan were
behind everything, supporting the process.

This mentally ill humanity, destroyed families, twisted moral values,
manifest or repressed homosexuality in human beings, anti natural
feminism rebellion, drug addiction, corrupt social outlines, mad
youths without direction, non respect to hierarchies, convulsed
nations, misanthropy, misogyny, paedophilia, irrational and feeble
lasciviousness and all other type of existent aberrations, are due to
the vast manoeuvre that Satan executed through his main marionettes
the Beatles and the Rolling Stones, from the Devil's Island.
If you wonder why there is misery and curse in your house, it is
because you own some L.P, CD or another article related to the CURSED
BY GOD Beatles and Rolling Stones. We recommend you to take that curse
out of your house throwing away everything related to the Devil's main
nine puppets....

You have been warned...
