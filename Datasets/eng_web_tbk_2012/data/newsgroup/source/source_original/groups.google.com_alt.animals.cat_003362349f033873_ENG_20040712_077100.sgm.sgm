I started this page to help with my boredom. I have Chronic Lyme
disease, so I'm stuck at home.
I started collecting animations &amp; jokes just to help with my boredom
and depression. I enjoyed the animations and wanted to share them with
my friends. So I started a small mailing list and added their
addresses to it. Along with an area on the page for those to join the
mailing list. I started with 21 email addresses. We now have over 5000
addresses.

My wife and I would love for you to come and visit our page
