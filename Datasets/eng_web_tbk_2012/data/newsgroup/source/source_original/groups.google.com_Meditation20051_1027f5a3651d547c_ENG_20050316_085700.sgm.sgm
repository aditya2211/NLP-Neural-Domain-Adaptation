Kaoshikii is a dance which was invented in 1978 by Shrii Shrii
A'nandamu'rti. It is a psycho-spiritual exercise and benefiting the mind
by developing stamina and strength. Kaoshikii is especially good for
women. It can ward off and cure a number of diseases, keeps the body
youthful and enables an easy delivery in childbirth.

Kaoshikii comes from the Sanskrit word 'kosa' meaning shell or layer of
mind. The self of the individual lies hidden in the innermost layers of
existence (kosas). Thus kaoshikii is a blossoming of the microcosm (unit
being) in its attempt to attain a link with the Macrocosm (Cosmic
Consciousness). This attempt is normally referred to as mysticism.

The Dance

The eighteen steps of the dance are done rhythmically. First the dancer
begins in the starting position: the hands together and raised over the
head. Then to the beat of &quot;dhin, dhin,... ,ta', ta'&quot;, the dancers begin
their step, placing the big toe behind the heel of the other foot. In
the final two steps, the dancers firmly stamp their feet on the ground.
Kaoshikii can be danced for as many rounds as you like.

The Ideation

When the dancers start the step with the beat of &quot;dhin, dhin...&quot;, the
mental ideation should also be kept. Here is
the ideation.

The two hands when upraised and folded together represent: &quot;Now I am
trying to establish a link with Parama Purus'a (Supreme Consciousness).&quot;

Bending to the right indicates: &quot;I know the right way to request You.&quot;

Bending to the left indicates: &quot;I know how to fulfil Your demands.&quot;

Bending forward suggests: &quot;I completely surrender to You.&quot;

Bending backward represents: &quot;I am ready to face all obstacles that may
come.&quot;

The last two steps represent: &quot;O Lord I repeat Your cosmic rhythm.&quot;
