With protests going on in the Chilean capital of Santiago (from the economic summit), President Bush visited Chinese President Hu Jintao and other key allies in Santiago. The talk of the day besides a more level playing field with China was North Korea. China has been a great help at getting North Korea to the table and Bush is hoping that with their cooperation Korea can become a nuclear free peninsula.

Hopefully President Bush can accomplish these goals which will not only help strengthen our Chinese allies, but will also help fight the war on terror. Selah!
