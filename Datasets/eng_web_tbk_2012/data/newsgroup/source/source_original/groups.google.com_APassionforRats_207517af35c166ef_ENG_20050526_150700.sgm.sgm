This is a beautiful site and a wonderful idea. And a portion of each package or memorial purchased goes to a charity on their database.

So be sure to get your pet's memorial on the site and if you have a charity / rescue, make sure it is listed on their database so you can receive some of the profits from the site.

Best,
Cindy
