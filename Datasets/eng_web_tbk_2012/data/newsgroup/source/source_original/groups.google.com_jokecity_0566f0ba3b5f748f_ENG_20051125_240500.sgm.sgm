Winston Peters is visiting a school.

In one class, he asks the students if anyone can give him an example of
a &quot;tragedy&quot;. One little boy stands up and offersthat, &quot;if my best
friend who lives next door was playing in the street when a car came
along and killed him, that would be a tragedy&quot;.

&quot;No,&quot; Winston says, &quot;That would be an ACCIDENT.&quot;

A girl raises her hand. &quot;If a school bus carrying fifty children drove
off a cliff, killing everyone involved... that would be a tragedy&quot;.
&quot;I'm afraid not, &quot;explains Winston, &quot;that is what we would call a GREAT
LOSS.&quot;

The room is silent, none of the other children volunteer. &quot;What?&quot; asks
Winston, &quot;isn't there any one here who can give me an example of a
tragedy?&quot;

Finally, a boy in the back raises his hand. In a timid voice, he says:
&quot;If an airplane carrying Winston Peters was blown up by a bomb, THAT
would be a tragedy&quot;.

&quot;Wonderful!&quot; Winston beams. &quot;Marvelous! And can you tell me WHY that
would be a tragedy?&quot;&quot;Well,&quot; says the boy, &quot;because it wouldn't be an
accident, and it certainly wouldn't be a great loss!&quot;
