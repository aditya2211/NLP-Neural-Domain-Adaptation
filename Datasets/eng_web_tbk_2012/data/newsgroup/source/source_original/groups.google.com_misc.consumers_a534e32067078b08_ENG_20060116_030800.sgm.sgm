Attack on Iran: A Looming Folly
By William Rivers Pitt
t r u t h o u t | Perspective

Monday 09 January 2006

The wires have been humming since before the New Year with reports
that the Bush administration is planning an attack on Iran. &quot;The Bush
administration is preparing its NATO allies for a possible military
strike against suspected nuclear sites in Iran in the New Year,
according to German media reports, reinforcing similar earlier
suggestions in the Turkish media,&quot; reported UPI on December 30th.

&quot;The Berlin daily Der Tagesspiegel this week,&quot; continued UPI,
&quot;quoted 'NATO intelligence sources' who claimed that the NATO allies had
been informed that the United States is currently investigating all
possibilities of bringing the mullah-led regime into line, including
military options. This 'all options are open' line has been President
George W Bush's publicly stated policy throughout the past 18 months.&quot;

An examination of the ramifications of such an attack is desperately
in order.

1.  Blowback in Iraq

The recent elections in Iraq were dominated by an amalgam of
religiously fundamentalist Shi'ite organizations, principally the Dawa
Party and the Supreme Council for Islamic Revolution in Iraq (SCIRI).
Both Dawa and SCIRI have umbilical connections to the fundamentalist
Shi'ite leadership in Iran that go back decades. In essence, Iran now
owns a significant portion of the Iraqi government.

Should the United States undertake military action against Iran, the
ramifications in Iraq would be immediate and extreme.

In the first eight days of January, eighteen US troops have been
killed in Iraq, compounded by another twelve deaths from a Black Hawk
helicopter crash on Saturday. Much of the violence aimed at American
forces is coming from disgruntled Sunni factions that have their own
militias, believe the last elections were a sham, and hold little
political power in the government.

If the US attacks Iran, it is probable that American forces -
already taxed by attacks from Sunni factions - will also face reprisal
attacks in Iraq from Shi'ite factions loyal to Iran. The result will be
a dramatic escalation in US and civilian casualties, US forces will be
required to bunker themselves further into their bases, and US forces
will find themselves required to fight the very government they just
finished helping into power. Iraq, already a seething cauldron, will
sink further into chaos.

2.  Iran's Armaments

Unlike Iraq, Iran has not spent the last fifteen years having its
conventional forces worn down by grueling sanctions, repeated attacks,
and two American-led wars. While Iran's conventional army is not what it
was during the heyday of the Iran-Iraq war - their armaments have
deteriorated and the veterans of that last war have retired - the nation
enjoys substantial military strength nonetheless.

According to a report issued by the Center for Strategic and
International Studies in December of 2004, Iran &quot;has some 540,000 men
under arms and over 350,000 reserves. They include 120,000 Iranian
Revolutionary Guards trained for land and naval asymmetrical warfare.
Iran's military also includes holdings of 1,613 main battle tanks,
21,600 other armored fighting vehicles, 3,200 artillery weapons, 306
combat aircraft, 60 attack helicopters, 3 submarines, 59 surface
combatants, and 10 amphibious ships.&quot;

&quot;Iran is now the only regional military power that poses a
significant conventional military threat to Gulf stability,&quot; continued
the CSIS report. &quot;Iran has significant capabilities for asymmetric
warfare, and poses the additional threat of proliferation. There is
considerable evidence that it is developing both a long-range missile
force and a range of weapons of mass destruction. It has never properly
declared its holdings of chemical weapons, and the status of its
biological weapons programs is unknown.&quot;

A MILNET brief issued in February 2005 reports, &quot;Due to its position
astride the Persian Gulf, Iran has constantly been a threat to the Gulf.
The so called 'Tanker' wars in the late 1980s put Iran squarely in the
bullseye of all nations seeking to transport oil out of the region. Even
the small navy that Iran puts to sea is capable enough to harass
shipping, and several cases of small boat operations against oil well
heads in the Gulf during that period made it clear small asymmetrical
tactics of the Iranian Navy could be quite effective.&quot;

&quot;More concerning,&quot; continued the MILNET brief, &quot;is the priority
placed on expanding and modernizing its Navy. The CSIS report cites
numerous areas where Iran has funded modernization including the most
troublesome aspect, anti-shipping cruise missiles: 'Iran has obtained
new anti-ship missiles and missile patrol craft from China, midget
submarines from North Korea, submarines from Russia, and modern mines.'&quot;

It is Iran's missile armaments that pose the greatest concern for
American forces in the Gulf, especially for the US Navy. Iran's coast
facing the Persian Gulf is a looming wall of mountains that look down
upon any naval forces arrayed in those waters. The Gulf itself only has
one exit, the Strait of Hormuz, which is also dominated by the
mountainous Iranian coastline. In essence, Iran holds the high ground in
the Gulf. Missile batteries arrayed in those mountains could raise
bloody havoc with any fleet deployed below.

Of all the missiles in Iran's armament, the most dangerous is the
Russian-made SS-N-22 Sunburn. These missiles are, simply, the fastest
anti-ship weapons on the planet. The Sunburn can reach Mach 3 at high
altitude. Its maximum low-altitude speed is Mach 2.2, some three times
faster than the American-made Harpoon. The Sunburn takes two short
minutes to cover its full range. The missile's manufacturers state that
one or two missiles could cripple a destroyer, and five missiles could
sink a 20,000 ton ship. The Sunburn is also superior to the Exocet
missile. Recall that it was two Exocets that ripped the USS Stark to
shreds in 1987, killing 37 sailors. The Stark could not see them to stop
them.

The US aircraft carrier Theodore Roosevelt is currently deployed in
the Persian Gulf, with some 7,000 souls aboard. Sailing with the
Roosevelt is the Tarawa Expeditionary Strike Force, which includes the
USS Tarawa, the USS Austin, and the USS Pearl Harbor. The USS Austin is
likewise deployed in the Gulf. The Sunburn missile, with its incredible
speed and ability to avoid radar detection, would do terrible damage
these ships if Iran chooses to retaliate in the Gulf after an American
attack within its borders.

Beyond the naval threat is the possibility of Iran throwing its
military muscle into the ongoing struggle in Iraq. Currently, the US is
facing an asymmetrical attack from groups wielding small arms,
shoulder-fired grenades and roadside bombs. The vaunted American
military has suffered 2,210 deaths and tens of thousands of wounded from
this form of warfare. The occupation of Iraq has become a guerrilla war,
a siege that has lasted more than a thousand days. If Iran decides to
throw any or all of its 23,000 armored fighting vehicles, along with any
or all of its nearly million-strong army, into the Iraq fray, the
situation in the Middle East could become unspeakably dire.

3.  The Syrian Connection

In February of 2005, Iran and Syria agreed upon a mutual protection
pact to combat &quot;challenges and threats&quot; in the region. This was a
specific reaction to the American invasion of Iraq, and a reaction to
America's condemnation of Syria after the death of Lebanese Prime
Minister Rafik Hariri, which was widely seen as an assassination ordered
from Damascus. An attack on Iran would trigger this mutual defense pact,
and could conceivably bring Syria into direct conflict with American
forces.

Like Iran, Syria's military is nothing to scoff at. Virtually every
credible analysis has Syria standing as the strongest military force in
the Middle East after Israel. Damascus has been intent for years upon
establishing significant military strength to serve as a counterweight
to Israel's overwhelming capabilities. As of 2002, Syria had some
215,000 soldiers under arms, 4,700 tanks, and a massive artillery
capability. The Syrian Air Force is comprised of ten to eleven
fighter/attack squadrons and sixteen fighter squadrons, totaling
somewhere near 650 aircraft.

Syria also possesses one of the largest arsenals of ballistic
missiles in the region, comprised primarily of SCUD-derived systems.
Iran, North Korea and China have been willing providers of
state-of-the-art technologies. Compounding this is the well-based
suspicion that Syria has perhaps the most advanced chemical weapons
capability in the Persian Gulf.

4.  China and the US Economy

While the ominous possibilities of heightened Iraqi chaos, missiles
in the Gulf, and Syrian involvement loom large if the US attacks Iran,
all pale in comparison to the involvement of China in any US/Iran
engagement.

China's economy is exploding, hampered only by their great thirst
for petroleum and natural gas to fuel their industry. In the last
several months, China has inked deals with Iran for $70 billion dollars
worth of Iranian oil and natural gas. China will purchase 250 million
tons of liquefied natural gas from Iran over the next 30 years, will
develop the massive Yadavaran oil field in Iran, and will receive
150,000 barrels of oil per day from that field. China is seeking the
construction of a pipeline from Iran to the Caspian Sea, where it would
link with another planned pipeline running from Kazakhstan to China.

Any US attack on Iran could be perceived by China as a direct threat
to its economic health. Further, any fighting in the Persian Gulf would
imperil the tankers running China's liquefied natural gas through the
Strait of Hormuz. Should China decide to retaliate against the US to
defend its oil and natural gas deal with Iran, the US would be faced
with a significant threat. This threat exists not merely on a military
level, though China could force a confrontation in the Pacific by way of
Taiwan. More significantly, China holds a large portion of the American
economy in the palm of its hand.

Paul Craig Roberts, writing for The American Conservative, said in
July of 2005 that &quot;As a result of many years of persistent trade
surpluses with the United States, the Japanese government holds dollar
reserves of approximately $1 trillion. China's accumulation of dollars
is approximately $600 billion. South Korea holds about $200 billion.
These sums give these countries enormous leverage over the United
States. By dumping some portion of their reserves, these countries could
put the dollar under intense pressure and send U.S. interest rates
skyrocketing. Washington would really have to anger Japan and Korea to
provoke such action, but in a showdown with China - over Taiwan, for
example - China holds the cards. China and Japan, and the world at
large, have more dollar reserves than they require. They would have no
problem teaching a hegemonic superpower a lesson if the need arose.&quot;

&quot;The hardest blow on Americans,&quot; concluded Roberts, &quot;will fall when
China does revalue its currency. When China's currency ceases to be
undervalued, American shoppers in Wal-Mart, where 70 percent of the
goods on the shelves are made in China, will think they are in Neiman
Marcus. Price increases will cause a dramatic reduction in American real
incomes. If this coincides with rising interest rates and a setback in
the housing market, American consumers will experience the hardest times
since the Great Depression.&quot;

In short, China has the American economy by the throat. Should they
decide to squeeze, we will all feel it. China's strong hand in this even
extends to the diplomatic realm; China is a permanent member of the
United Nations Security Council, and could veto any actions against Iran
proposed by the United States.

5.  American Preparedness

American citizens have for decades taken it as a given that our
military can overwhelm and overcome any foe on the battlefield. The
rapid victory during the first Gulf War cemented this perception. The
last three years of the Iraq occupation, however, have sapped this
confidence. Worse, the occupation has done great damage to the strength
of the American military, justifying the decrease in confidence. Thanks
to repeated deployments to Iraq and Afghanistan, recruiting is at an
all-time low. Soldiers with vital training and know-how are refusing to
re-enlist. Across the board, the American military is stretched to the
breaking point.

Two vaunted economists - one a Nobel Prize winner and the other a
nationally renowned budget expert - have analyzed the data at hand and
put a price tag on the Iraq occupation. According to Linda Bilmes of
Harvard and Nobel Laureate Joseph E. Stiglitz of Columbia University,
the final cost of the Iraq occupation will run between $1 trillion and
$2 trillion, surpassing by orders of magnitude the estimates put forth
by the Bush administration. If an engagement with Iran envelops our
forces in Iraq, and comes to involve Syria, our economy will likely
shatter under the strain of fighting so many countries simultaneously.
Add to this the economic threat posed by China, and the economic threat
implicit in any substantial disruption of the distribution of Mideast
petroleum to the globe.

If Iran and Syria - with their significant armaments, missile
technologies and suspected chemical weapons capabilities - decide to
engage with the relatively undersized US force in Iraq, our troops there
will be fish in a barrel. Iran's position over the Gulf would make
resupply by ship and air support from carriers a dangerous affair. In
the worst-case scenario, the newly-minted American order of battle
requiring the use of nuclear weapons to rescue a surrounded and
imperiled force could come into play, hurling the entire planet into
military and diplomatic bedlam.

Conclusion: Is Any of This Possible?

The question must be put as directly as possible: what manner of
maniac would undertake a path so fraught with peril and potential
economic catastrophe? It is difficult to imagine a justification for any
action that could envelop the United States in a military and economic
conflict with Iraq, Iran, Syria and China simultaneously.

Iran is suspected by many nations of working towards the development
of nuclear weapons, but even this justification has been tossed into a
cocked hat. Recently, Russian president Vladimir Putin bluntly stated
that Iran is not developing its nuclear capability for any reasons
beyond peaceful energy creation, and pledged to continue assisting Iran
in this endeavor. Therefore, any attack upon Iran's nuclear facilities
will bring Russia into the mess. Iran also stands accused of aiding
terrorism across the globe. The dangers implicit in any attack upon that
nation, however, seem to significantly offset whatever gains could be
made in the so-called &quot;War on Terror.&quot;

Unfortunately, all the dangers in the world are no match for the
self-assurance of a bubble-encased zealot. What manner of maniac would
undertake such a dangerous course? Look no further than 1600
Pennsylvania Avenue.

George W. Bush and his administration have consistently undertaken
incredibly dangerous courses of action in order to garner political
power on the home front. Recall the multiple terror threats lobbed out
by the administration whenever damaging political news appeared in the
media. More significantly, recall Iraq. Karl Rove, Bush's most senior
advisor, notoriously told Republicans on the ballot during the 2002
midterms to &quot;run on the war.&quot; The invasion of Iraq provided marvelous
political cover for the GOP not only during those midterms, but during
the 2004 Presidential election.

What kind of political cover would be gained from an attack on Iran,
and from the diversion of attention to that attack? The answer lies in
one now-familiar name: Jack Abramoff. The Abramoff scandal threatens to
subsume all the hard-fought GOP gains in Congress, and the 2006 midterms
are less than a year away.

Is any of this a probability? Logic says no, but logic seldom plays
any part in modern American politics. All arguments that the Bush
administration would be insane to attack Iran and risk a global
conflagration for the sake of political cover run into one unavoidable
truth.

They did it once already in Iraq.
