NASA &amp; Company Diplomacy - Trying to keep Moon Landing Hoax a secret in
modern times

Some strategies being used by NASA &amp; Company in relation to China and
other space planning countries are mentioned here after being gleaned
from a news item underneath.

Country has an Independent strategy = NASA &amp; company to use &quot;Numero
Uno&quot; strategy, try to assert, beat, mesh and control the space
program of the country. This can also be through political,
economical, social, and technological influence.

Country not open or not have fixed strategy = NASA &amp; Company to use
&quot;freeze thawed&quot; strategy especially when the country has a
challenging, growing and ambitious space program. This can also be
through political, economical, social, and technological influence.

Dependant = NASA &amp; Company to use &quot;space station&quot; model to unify
the aims of different countries. This is really an end goal aim of
NASA &amp; Company and also does not allow anyone challenging the moon
landing hoax. The target for NASA &amp; Company probably to get by 2018
all the ambitious space program countries shifting towards this model,
through the propaganda of another moon mission; deliberately failing
this or trying hard for another moon landing hoax; achieving the real
aim of space unity between space programs of other countries.

China launches its second manned spaceflight mission
Secretive efforts keep outsiders in the dark about the program's goals

China launched Shenzhou VI, its second manned spacecraft, early today
in northwest China's Gansu Province.
A pair of military pilots embarked on China's second manned space
flight early today, hurtling into orbit on a test mission that could
span five days.

The crew of the Shenzhou VI spacecraft was identified as Fei Junlong,
40, and Nie Haishen, 41, by China's official news agency.

The successful launch from the Jiuquan Satellite Launch Center in
northwest China follows the solo flight of Yang Liwei in October 2003.
His one-day mission vaulted his communist homeland into the elite
circle of spacefaring nations - Russia and the United States - that
can launch and sustain humans in space.

Most experts believe China intends to develop a small space station of
its own over the next several years.

But they remain uncertain about whether China aims to beat the United
States to the moon in its secretive space effort. President Bush has
directed NASA to return to the moon by 2018 with a new generation of
human explorers.

China's &quot;is not a fly-by-night program,&quot; said Joan Johnson-Freese, an
expert on national security who follows space developments in the Asian
nation at the Naval War College in Newport, R.I.

&quot;They are not in any hurry. They want a program that will be a
success,&quot; Johnson-Freese said. &quot;They are not going to rush it, because
they don't want it to be a budget buster. Economics will be a big
determiner in the speed of their program.&quot;

China's overtures to join the U.S.-led effort to develop the 16-nation
international space station have been thwarted for more than a decade
over a range of issues, including the Asian country's human rights
policies and worries it could acquire technologies that could pose a
security threat.

The freeze thawed some after Yang's 2003 mission. China was among 30
nations invited to send a delegate to NASA-sponsored roundtable
discussions on Bush's strategy to reach the moon with astronauts as the
first step in the exploration of Mars and other-deep space
destinations.

&quot;We applaud China's space achievements,&quot; NASA spokesman Allard Beutel
said Tuesday. &quot;We wish them a successful return of their astronauts.&quot;

He stressed, however, that NASA would not follow this week's Chinese
mission through formal channels.

At present, there are no plans for additional meetings with foreign
powers to discuss the Bush exploration initiative or to extend an
invitation to China to join the space station partnership, Beutel said.

The flight of Fei and Nie could mark the end of the opening chapter in
a three-phase Chinese space initiative, Johnson-Freese said.

The first phase, she said, will demonstrate the capability of a
multi-compartment spacecraft that will leave a test module in orbit
when the two fliers return to Earth. The Chinese program's second phase
will include spacewalks on future missions and demonstrations of
docking and undocking techniques. The final phase will feature the
assembly and operation of a longer-duration space lab.

At least one expert believes China's intentions might include a
surprise attempt to circle the moon with astronauts before NASA's
planned lunar return.

&quot;The Americans would be wise to plan accordingly,&quot; said John E. Pike,
director of the Alexandria, Va.-based GlobalSecurity.org, a small
national security think tank.

&quot;There is always the possibility they could jam us up, make us look
like we are not numero uno,&quot; Pike said.

During the U.S. and Russian lunar race during the Cold War, NASA scored
an early coup by circling the moon with the Apollo 8 crew over the 1968
Christmas holidays. As it turned out, the Soviets never made it to the
moon.

&quot;(China) could be the second country to do that,&quot; Pike said. &quot;They
would get in line in front of the Russians. And they would not have to
land on the moon to take us down a notch.&quot;

Pike's concern is based on China's development of a new medium-lift
rocket, the Long March V, and the construction of a new space launch
complex on Hainan Island in the South China Sea.

The two developments, he said, could eventually enable China's space
program to mature to the point that experts could assemble and launch
from Earth's orbit a spacecraft capable of circling the moon with
astronauts and returning home.
