Hello dear list members,

The multiple planetary afflictions are taking their toll. Currently, Mercury
and Venus is conjunct and the conjunction is being closely aspected by Rahu.

In Pakistan national chart besides the transit affliction to transit Venus
in the fourth house by FMs Rahu and Mercury, natal Saturn and Venus are
also under the close affliction of transit Rahu. This has resulted in a
major rail accident in Pakistan involving three trains and involving more
than 300 deaths.

In Indian national chart besides the transit affliction to transit Mercury
by Rahu and Venus the natal Saturn and Venus are also under the transit
affliction of Rahu which has resulted into floods in many parts of the
country taking toll of human lives, properties, etc.
