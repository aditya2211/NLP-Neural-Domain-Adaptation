China's insatiable demand for energy is prompting fears of financial
and diplomatic collisions around the globe as it seeks reliable
supplies of oil from as far away as Brazil and Sudan.

An intrusion into Japanese territorial waters by a Chinese nuclear
submarine last week and a trade deal with Brazil are the latest
apparently unconnected consequences of China's soaring economic growth.

Increased car usage in China is creating a high demand for petrol
The connection, however, lies in an order issued last year by President
Hu Jintao to seek secure oil supplies abroad - preferably ones which
could not be stopped by America in case of conflict over Taiwan.

The submarine incident was put down to a &quot;technical error&quot; by the
Chinese government, which apologised to Japan.

But even before the incident the People's Daily, the government
mouthpiece, had commented that competition over the East China Sea
between the two countries was &quot;only a prelude of the game between China
and Japan in the arena of international energy&quot;.

The Brazil trade deal included funding for a joint oil-drilling and
pipeline programme at a cost that experts said would add up to three
times the cost of simply buying oil on the market.

The West, however, has paid little attention to these developments. For
the United States and Europe are far more concerned with the even more
sensitive issues of China's relations with &quot;pariah states&quot;.

In September, China threatened to veto any move to impose sanctions on
Sudan over the atrocities in Darfur. It has invested $3 billion in the
African country's oil industry, which supplies it with seven per cent
of its needs.

Then, this month, it said that it opposed moves to refer Iran's nuclear
stand-off with the International Atomic Energy Agency to the United
Nations Security Council.

A week before, China's second biggest state oil firm had signed a $70
billion deal for oilfield and natural gas development with Iran, which
already supplies 13 per cent of China's needs.

China has its own reserves of oil and natural gas and once was a net
oil exporter. But as its economy has expanded by an average of nine per
cent per year for the last two decades, so has its demand for energy.

This year it overtook Japan as the world's second largest consumer of
energy, behind the US.

Its projected demand, boosted by a huge rise in car ownership as well
as the need to find alternatives to polluting coal for electricity
generation, has contributed to the surge in the price of oil this year.
Shortages are already leading to power cuts in the big cities.

Since President Hu ordered state-owned oil firms to &quot;go abroad&quot; to
ensure supply, they have begun drilling for gas in the East China Sea,
just west of the line that Japan regards as its border.

Japan protested, to no avail, that the project should be a joint one.

The two are also set to clash over Russia's oil wealth. China is
furious that Japan has outbid it in their battle to determine the route
of the pipeline that Russia intends to build to the Far East.

Japan favoured a route to the sea, enabling oil to be shipped to both
Japan and China. China wanted an overland route through its own
territory, which would give it ultimate control if hostilities broke
out.

Increasingly, analysts are saying that China's efforts have gone beyond
what is safe or even in its own interests.

Claude Mandil, the executive director of the International Energy
Agency in Paris, said the reserves in the East China Sea were hardly
worth the trouble.

&quot;Nobody thinks that there will be a lot of oil and gas in this part of
the world,&quot; he said.

&quot;It may be a difficult political issue but I don't think the energy
content is worthwhile.&quot;

Eurasia Group, a New York-based firm of political analysts, said its
oil experts worked out that China was paying such an inflated price for
its investment in Brazil that the cost for the oil it ended up with was
three times the market price.

&quot;If China's economy falters, which, in my view, appears increasingly
likely, then commodity prices will plummet, and with them, the value of
the assets that produce them,&quot; Jason Kindopp, Eurasia's lead China
analyst, said.

&quot;Beijing may end up in a early 1990s Japan situation, where it is
forced to sell recently purchased overseas assets for a fraction of
what it paid for them.&quot;

China's wider aggression to secure oil and gas was the greatest threat
to its international standing in the next decade.

&quot;Sudan is the primary example,&quot; he said.

&quot;It marks the first time in recent years that China has promised to
wield its veto power in the UN Security Council against a petition
initiated by the United States and backed by France and Great Britain.&quot;
