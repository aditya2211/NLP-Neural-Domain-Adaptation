the industry of Marriage and Kids, you heard me. Marriage is, in and of
itself, a noble concept, but it too often leads to kids and kids flat out
suck. How can I say such an abomination, ask you? Look around you and
notice all the mind numbing trailor trash cretins out there who should
not be procreating, yet they do. These are the people who keep Jerry
springer on the air. These are the kids who will destroy society, because
of the crapfest the American family has become under the post hippie
culture, you heard again. And you might think by reading this I blame the
kids.....
Not so,
Kids are what kids are and will do what they do. It is literally
monkey see and monkey do with them. That will likely never change.
It's the bad parents out there who fuck up their lives and dont seem
to understand that once you decide to have kids, it is indeed time to
grow up and be a responsible role model for those kids. Very few parents
do this. And this is a direct result of the Politically correct,
permissive, time out granting bullshit liberal culture that has caused
this. When you blame it all on society, there's noone to to take
responsibility and all of a sudden you have generation of fucked up kids
who are likley smoking, drinking, doing drugs, fucking the neighbor or
some internet perv just because you are too lazy to see waht they're
doing. People like this will never have my sympathy, nor do they deserve
my sympathy. Look inside yourselves parents, is this you? Probably it is.
Fuck you. Stop trying to pawn your brats off on others to &quot;get a break&quot; .
You made a choice to be a mommy, you dont get a break until they move
out, thats the choice that you madea and that's life. Tough shit. Just
because you're stuck, doesnt give you the right to drag down all the
singles around you.
Another time I'll segueway into all the fun work related instances
where &quot;Mommies&quot; get out of doing work and hiding behind childcare as the
reason. This is the insidious conspiracy I call &quot;Mommism&quot;. It must be
stamped out.
