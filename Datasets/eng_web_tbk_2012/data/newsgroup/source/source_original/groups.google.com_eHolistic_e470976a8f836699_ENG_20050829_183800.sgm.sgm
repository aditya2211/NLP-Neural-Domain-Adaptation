Once upon a time (in 2001, to be specific), the Coca-Cola corporation
built a bottling plant in a small and remote Indian village in the
state of Kerala. In exchange for sucking vast amounts of water out of
the local land, the mighty corporation promised to bring the people
great wealth. But within a few short months, the village people began
to notice their wells were running dry, so they complained to the
corporation. Coca-Cola calmed the concerns of the people and attempted
to win back their favor by giving them vast amounts of free fertilizer,

saying it would grow bountiful crops beyond their wildest dreams. After

several years of use, we arrive at the present day when the village
people have suddenly discovered the fertilizer is actually the bottling

plant's waste sludge and is laden with cadmium, a highly toxic,
cancer-causing heavy metal. The village soil and water are now too
heavily contaminated to safely occupy human life, so the plant was shut

down last week. Moral of the story: Don't drink Coke..........drink
Pepsi! Just kidding, Pepsi is actually in the process of being thrown
out of India for similar crimes, as well.
