Healing the Collective Body

In George Orwell's influential novel &quot;1984&quot; doublethink is a
device promoted by the totalitarian state government to make people
accept two irreconcilable ideas at the same time such as &quot;war is
peace&quot;. I see the merit in flowing with duality. One of my most
cherished dualities is the understanding that we are both autonomous
individuals with the power to shape our personal destinies and at the
same time we are all one, that there is no separation between you and
I, we are all together in this thing called life, we human beings, the
birds and the tress, the rocks and the sky, all of it. I have written a
lot recently about healing the self so today here are a few words on
healing our collective body, mind and soul.

Think of all life, if you will, as one great choir or one grand
congregation. Our strength is in our unity and harmony. Any major
dischord and we all suffer. Any insult to the collective good brings us
all down. Living out of synch with nature is the great disease, from
that flows all the tributaries we have come to think of as sickness.
We are only as strong as our weakest, we are only as healthy as the
sickest amongst us- playing sports and being in the army taught me that
lesson before I was finished being a teenager.

When the healthy treat the sick with scorn and intolerance it brings us
all down. When those lucky enough not to have Herpes create a climate
of shame and indignity for those of us who do, not only are they
hurting us, but they are hurting themselves. There is no escape from
the collective ocean we all swim in.

What you project will always come back to either reward or haunt you.
We are now suffering from the consequences of our rape of the
environment, our rejection of the natural for the industrial, and our
embrace of violence over peace.

Jesus said that what you do the least of the people you do to him.
What are you doing to the least of the people?

If we are all in this thing together, let's play nice. Remember that
what you do to yourself affects me and everybody else, remember that
what you do to me and anyone else shapes your destiny.

No matter what progress we make as individuals in becoming healthier,
we will never achieve real health until we collectively decide to
create a healthier reality.
Fortunately circumstances will force our hand soon since our collective
bad behaviour cannot continue indefinitely. In the near future
collective choices will need to be made. Will we choose to live in
harmony with this planet or crash and burn in a conflagration of
arrogance and disregard? Will we choose to rise about prejudice and
intolerance or go down kicking and screaming with holding on to fear
and anger?

There is no health without peace and no peace without health.
