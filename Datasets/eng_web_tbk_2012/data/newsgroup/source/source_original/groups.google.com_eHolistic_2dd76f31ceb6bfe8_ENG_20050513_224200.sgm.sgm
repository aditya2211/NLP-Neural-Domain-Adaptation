Please take a moment to read this. I realize that it may sound
strange, but we are desparate in our efforts and are willing to try
anything to help our dear sick friend. This costs absolutely nothing,
and will take about one minute of your time. This is not a hoax, as so
many of these emails actully are.

In quick summary, Beyond Control, a local band in our area, is
sponoring a benefit for a cancer victim whose benefits have run out.
That band is involved in a local competition which promises a $5000
first prize, which they would like to win in order to donate it to the
benefit fund which they have started. Below are some emails to friends
explaining a little more about this effort. What we are trying to do
is solicit votes for the band, in order to put them in first place.
They are currently in third place, and need your help so that the prize
money can be used for a humanatarian cause. You can vote at the
following link, it will only take a few seconds. Please take a moment
to click on the link below and cast your vote for Beyond Control.
Thank you in advance for your contribution to this effort. Also,
please pass this along to everyone you know, and all of your email
contacts. We need the power of the internet to pull this off. The web
site is

You can check the validity of all of this at the Beyond Control
website. That address is  . The home page
for Rockin on the River is  , and it lists all
the acts scheduled for the season. You can check that out as well, to
confirm that this is all real, and for a worthy cause. Abby is our
beloved friend, and we are trying to raise money for her any way we
can, so this prize money is important to help her continue to receive
her life-saving treatments. Many thanks, and may God bless you all and
keep you healthy.

Here are some emails we have sent, along with the flyer for the Benefit
fund raiser we are holding in June, just for your information.

Roy,

I am sending you some info that I have passed along regarding
the effort to win the cash for the fund raising benefit. If you can
pass this info along, and ask everyone you know to forward it to their
contacts, etc, we may have a shot at pulling this off.

Thanks,
Fred

John,

I will attach the letter explaining the benefit we are
sponsoring. There is a link to the contest page. Any help in
distributing this will be greatly appreciated. It is certainly for a
good cause. Abby needs to fly to New York twice a month for these
treatments, and her time on the Federal Grant program has expired. She
doesn't have the funds to continue without the grant, and without these
treatments, her prognosis is grim. I hope you have a huge network.
Also encourage your recipients to forward this along to their contacts,
and so on, so that the movement to help her grows exponentially. We
must finish in first place in order to contribute the $5000 to the
benefit fund. Thank you so much for caring enough to offer your help.

Fred
