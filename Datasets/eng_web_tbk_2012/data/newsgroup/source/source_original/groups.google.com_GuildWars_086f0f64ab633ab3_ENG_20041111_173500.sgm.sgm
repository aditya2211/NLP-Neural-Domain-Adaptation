Hi all,

There are already several forums around the net focused on discussing
Guild Wars, so why create a new one? I say why not? The main reason is
Google is more accessible to the global community and you can rest
assured that it's not going to go away. I have seen great fan sites
suddenly disappear without notice and for no reason. Usually this
happens because the developer of the site can no longer afford the cost
of bandwidth being used.

That said, the maintenance of this forum is handled by Google and thus
will remain reliable and it will ultimately give us more time to play
:). I'm nothing more than a devoted fan of the game myself and I hope
that this area can become a haven for deep fan discussions.
Regards,
Humanpixel

Aye! Good Day Mate! Im really looking forward to Guild Wars. Anyone
know a release date?

Feb 2005

Feb 2005 is the projected release date, although Guild Wars is made by
ex-members of Blizzard, so Feb 2005 could mean August 2006...

Anyway, I tried to get a preorder but no places were selling it so I
missed out on 2/3 weekend events. Oh well, I'll get it when it comes
out in Febuary.

rumor has feb 05 on the calender. BUT they stated that they will take
as long as it takes to work out all the bugs so who really know how
long.

as far as pre order go to   and they have a list of
major retailers that carry it there are also a few websites that you
could order it off of.
and a good reason for starting this group....company firewalls lol ;)

I was kind of curious, what exactly is Guild Wars? I havn't heard of it.

Check out the Guild Wars Web site at   for more
info about the game. It's a massive multiplayer role playing game. The
graphics are without a doubt the amoung the best graphics I have ever
seen for any game and I have been gaming since the MUD days. It's worth
a look. I have a preorder and am even considering getting a second
preorder to have multiple accounts.

I have participated in all the weekend beta events and the world
preview. The game is already 100% functional. I can't imagine them not
being able to meet the Feb 05 deadline.

Warm greetings to all in this GW community.

I am Lady Kingel and I hail from the United Legit Gaming Guilds of
Guild Wars.

We are a consortium of legit honorable guilds that was established in
1997 for DI and we are now adding GW to the list of games played. The
alliance is a pretty straightforward one. It was formed to allow many
different guilds who were all strictly honorable to come together as a
family and allow them many people to game with. There are no other
requirements other than we ask that members greet each new member and
each new alliance and also feel free to post in any of the forums.

We are also a group who is looking for members for our own select guild
called ULGG of GW...which is a part of the alliance with the same name.
We play in all aspects of the game and we hand pick our members.

I would like to personally invite each of you to visit our website. You
are individuals of quality, and in our alliance we seek quality of
member over quantity of member. You will be asked to register, and
then you should wander over to the Announce Your Arrival Section and
present yourself. You will be greeted by many members of this
wonderful family.

I do hope to see you visiting us at the fire and we shall prepare a
feast for you, as well. If you paste this in your browser, it will take
you directly to our GW website.

I extend my hand to each of you in true friendship, and honor. Come
and say hello...you will be warmly welcomed!

We are currently moving to a new server, so we will be down for a
while. I will inform when we are up and running again. I wish all
happy holidays, and moreso, peace on earth.
