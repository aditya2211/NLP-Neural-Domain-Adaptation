I am looking for people who would like to play D&amp;D 3.5 and live in or
around the Chillicothe, OH area. We have two people so far, and I am
able to DM...although DM's are welcome. The games will have to take
place on Fri, Sat, or Sun. Please let me know if this sounds good, and
if you have any question, please ask. Thank you very much and we hope
to hear from you soon!
