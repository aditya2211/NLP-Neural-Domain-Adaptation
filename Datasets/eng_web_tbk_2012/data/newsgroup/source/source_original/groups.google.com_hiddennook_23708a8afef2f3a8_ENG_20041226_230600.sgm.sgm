Normally this author is semi-objective (what blogger is) but on the Seattlepi.com (see source link) Palestinian Leader Mahmoud Abbas has demanded that Israel leave all the land that it occupies before the 1967 border (which includes East Jerusalem by the way). One thing is certain for sure. If Abbas keeps up this "macho talk" he will kill potential peace talks and might as well allow Hamas (which has probably done a better job at providing for the Palestinians) rule the West Bank.

Interim Palestinian leader and the front-runner in the upcoming Jan. 9, 2005 presidential election Mahmoud Abbas talks during his first official campaign speech in the West Bank town of Ramallah, Saturday Dec. 25, 2004. Cloaking himself in Yasser Arafat's legacy, Abbas pledged to fulfill Palestinian dreams of statehood.

It seems that the Palestinian leadership (upcoming) will not be a peace partner with Israel. He is already demanding claims that Israel said no to not only the world, but to Arafat himself.
Listing his priorities, Abbas told supporters of the ruling Fatah party that he was determined to provide security to his people and continue the struggle against Israel's partially completed West Bank barrier.
Abbas also pledged to resolve the problem of millions of Palestinian refugees and their descendants. Abbas, a refugee himself from what is today the northern Israeli city of Safed, called the refugee issue "very important and very dangerous."
Having personally visited the West Bank and Israel, I can say that this new political voice is threatening to collapse the peace process. If Abbas does not change his former thinking and continues the path of Yasser Arafat, then there will not be peace in the Holy Land and the Palestinians will ultimately suffer. Selah!
