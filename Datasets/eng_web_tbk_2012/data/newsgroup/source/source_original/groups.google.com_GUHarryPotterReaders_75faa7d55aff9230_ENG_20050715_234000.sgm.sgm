I just finish reading a really good book (it was actually a ebook) from
some new series called the The Tale of Terra. The story had brillant
battle scenes, lovable heroes and villians, a compelling story line,
and it left me dying for the next part of the series:) go to
taleofterra.com to learn more aboout it
