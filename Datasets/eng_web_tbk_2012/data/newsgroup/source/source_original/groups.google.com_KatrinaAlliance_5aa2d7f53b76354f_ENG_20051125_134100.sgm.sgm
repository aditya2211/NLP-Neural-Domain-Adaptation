The Greater New Orleans Fair Housing Action Center (GNOFHAC) filed a
housing discrimination complaint against the Housing Authority of New
Orleans (HANO) last week.

The complaint, filed with the United States Department of Housing and
Urban Development, accuses HANO of violating a 2003 enforcement
agreement entered into between former St. Thomas Housing Development
residents, the City of New Orleans, HANO, and the U.S. Department of
Housing and Urban Development during the HOPE VI redevelopment of St.
Thomas, now known as River Garden.

The current complaints allege that HANO has not provided qualified
former St. Thomas residents a preference with respect to available
public housing units at River Garden per the 2003 agreement. Upon
return to New Orleans after the Hurricane Katrina evacuation, former
residents have been informed that there are no available public housing
units at River Garden because those units have been reserved for HANO
employees. Therefore, public housing residents have been unable to
secure the units for which they qualified prior to the storm and are
left homeless, as a result.

&quot;In the wake of Hurricane Katrina, affordable housing in New Orleans is
more scarce than ever. As such, it is essential that HANO comply with
2003 enforcement agreement,&quot; said James Perry, GNOFHAC Executive
Director
