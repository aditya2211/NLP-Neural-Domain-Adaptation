&lt;&lt; Upon the sixth of April, Alexander the Great was born.

Upon the same day he conquered Darius,
won a great victory at sea, &amp; died the same day.

Neither was this day less fortunate to his father Philip;

ANTONIO PEREZ 1535-1611 [Philip II's renegade Secretary of State]

&lt;&lt;In &quot;Love's Labour's Lost&quot; we find a character Don Adriana de Armatho,
full of affection and bombast. A Spanish refugee, ANTONIO PEREZ, visited
England in 1593 and became acquainted with Francis &amp; ANTHONY Bacon,
with whom for a time he seems to have been on terms of intimacy,
which did not last very long, for the Spaniard developed so much
affectation &amp; bombast that he became unpopular in Court circles.

In 1594 PEREZ wrote &amp; published a book
under the assumed name of &quot;RAPHAEL PEREGRINO.&quot;

In the play Holofernes is ridiculing Don Adriana
&quot;the traveler from Spain&quot; and says of him:

&quot;He is too picked, too spruce, too affected,
Too odd, as it were, too PEREGRINate, as I may call it.&quot;
-Act 5, Scene 1.

To make the reference more pointed and unmistakable, Sir
Nathaniel replies &quot;a most singular &amp; choice epithet,&quot; and
at once enters it in his note book. This parody on PEREZ'
sobriquet clearly identifies PEREZ with Armatho.&gt;&gt;

Subject: Re: Facts, Purpose of List, Italy, Jews

&lt;&lt;There were no Jews in England to speak of in the 1590's.
True, but two in England that we know of were a part of the
Essex entourage: Dr. Lopez, who had been physician to Essex'
step-father, the Earl of Leicester, had apparently treated
the young Essex for some socially unacceptable ailment,
and Antonio Perez, who was a guest at Essex House in the early
1590's. To be sure, both Lopez &amp; Perez were conversos--but they
were thought of in England as being, as they undoubtedly were,
at least ethnically, Jews.&gt;&gt;
---------------------------------------------------------------------
&lt;&lt;Doctor RODERIGO LOPEZ (1525 -1594) was the Portugese Jewish doctor
accused by Essex of trying to poison Queen Elizabeth. The 69 year old
Dr. Lopez was found guilty and was summarily hung and quartered on
June 7, 1594 at Tyburn. Long before (September 1560) Dr. Lopez had
been the personal house doctor of Robert Dudley and the good doctor
was obligated to write the death certificate for Amy Robsart
(stating that she had &quot;accidentally&quot; fallen down the stairs).

That same year (1560) a Spanish priest named RUY LOPEZ handily beat all
comers at a chess tournament in Rome. Lopez's 1561 book &quot;Libro de la
invencion liberal y arte del Juego del Acedraz&quot; became THE classic
on Chess openings, including the one that bears his name.

&lt;&lt;&quot;I have told you, friend,&quot; said the curate, &quot;that this is done to
divert our idle thoughts; and as in well-ordered states games of CHESS,
fives, and billiards are allowed for the diversion of those who do not
care, or are not obliged, or are unable to work, so books of this kind
are allowed to be printed, on the supposition that, what indeed is the
truth, there can be nobody so ignorant as to take any of them for true
stories;&gt;&gt;

&lt;&lt;&quot;Well then,&quot; said Don Quixote, &quot;the same thing happens in the comedy
and life of this world, where some play emperors, others popes, and,
in short, all the characters that can be brought into a play; but when
it is over, that is to say when life ends, death strips them all of
the garments that distinguish one from the other, and all are equal
in the grave.&quot;
&quot;A fine comparison!&quot; said Sancho; &quot;though not so new but that I have
heard it many and many a time, as well as that other one of the game
of CHESS; how, so long as the game lasts, each piece has its own
particular office, and when the game is finished they are all mixed,
jumbled up and shaken together, and stowed away in the bag, which is
much like ending life in the grave.&quot;
&quot;Thou art growing less doltish and more shrewd every day, Sancho,&quot;
said Don Quixote.
&quot;Ay,&quot; said Sancho; &quot;it must be that some of your worship's shrewdness
sticks to me; land that, of itself, is barren and dry, will come to
yield good fruit if you dung it and till it&gt;&gt;

Of all Freemason sponsered revolutions: American, French, Bolivar,
etc. . . Garibaldi's is the most blatantly Masonic:

Nostromo A Tale of the Seaboard

&lt;&lt;After having written so far, Don Martin Decoud, the exotic dandy of
the Parisian boulevard, got up and walked across the sanded floor of the
cafe at one end of the Albergo of United Italy, kept by Giorgio Viola,
the old companion of Garibaldi. The highly coloured lithograph of the
Faithful Hero seemed to look dimly, in the light of one candle, at the
man with no faith in anything except the truth of his own sensations.
Looking out of the window, Decoud was met by a darkness so impenetrable
that he could see neither the mountains nor the town, nor yet the
buildings near the harbour; and there was not a sound, as if the
tremendous obscurity of the Placid Gulf, spreading from the waters over
the land, had made it dumb as well as blind. . . .He turned away. He
could bear no longer that expressionless and motionless stare, which
seemed to have a sort of impenetrable emptiness like the black depth of
an abyss.

. . . and uneasy in its corporate expression, was overtopped by the
big face of Don Juste Lopez, soft and white, with prominent eyelids
and wreathed in impenetrable solemnity as if in a dense cloud.&gt;&gt;

Wisteria Lodge

&lt;&lt;He could do little during the day, for Murillo took every precaution and
never went out save with his satellite Lucas, or Lopez as he was known in
the days of his greatness. At night, however, he slept alone, and the
avenger might find him. On a certain evening, which had been prearranged, I
sent my friend final instructions, for the man was forever on the alert and
continually changed his room. I was to see that the doors were open and the
signal of a green or white light in a window which faced the drive was to
give notice if all was safe or if the attempt had better be postponed.

&quot;But everything went wrong with us. In some way I had excited the suspicion
of Lopez, the secretary. He crept up behind me and sprang upon me just as I
had finished the note. He and his master dragged me to my room and held
judgment upon me as a convicted traitress. Then and there they would have
plunged their knives into me could they have seen how to escape the
consequences of the deed. Finally, after much debate, they concluded that my
murder was too dangerous. But they determined to get rid forever of Garcia.
They had gagged me, and Murillo twisted my arm round until I gave him the
address. I swear that he might have twisted it off had I understood what it
would mean to Garcia. Lopez addressed the note which I had written, sealed
it with his sleeve-link, and sent it by the hand of the servant, Jose. How
they murdered him I do not know, save that it was Murillo's hand who struck
him down, for Lopez had remained to guard me. I believe he must have waited
among the gorse bushes through which the path winds and struck him down as
he passed. At first they were of a mind to let him enter the house and to
kill him as a detected burglar; but they argued that if they were mixed up
in an inquiry their own identity would at once be publicly disclosed and
they would be open to further attacks. With the death of Garcia, the pursuit
might cease, since such a death might frighten others from the task.&gt;&gt;
