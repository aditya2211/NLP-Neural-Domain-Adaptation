<en=3>It looks like NASA is ready to sour again after it's devastating loss from the Columbia accident which occurred nearly two years ago .
<en=4>Now , NASA engineers and astronauts are almost giddy with " go " fever as the tentative date for the first launch since the Columbia disaster approaches .
<en=5>The most important question is n't whether Discovery is technically ready to fly with new safety features and emergency procedures , but whether the agency itself has learned from the crucial errors most common to Challenger and Columbia , errors that grew out of a management culture that discouraged criticism and sacrificed safety for image - puffing and budget - cutting .
<en=6>I hope so .
<en=7>Seeing another " Columbia " incident can be quite frightening ( I woke up to it early in the morning when I was in Texas ) .
<en=8>We do n't need another incident as exploring the cosmos is something that keeps our imagination going as a species .
<en=9>Maybe one day they will allow space tourism , ( hopefully that will be in the near future ) although I would recommend that NASA build new shuttles instead of trying to preserve the older ones .
<en=10>You do have to give NASA credit on some things as they have eliminated the " fear of reporting failure " culture that probably led to the lack of reporting defects on the Columbia shuttle .
<en=11>Instead they are encouraging everyone to come forward if they see any potential problems ( as it is clear that overlooked problems could result in unnecessary losses ) .
<en=12>But supporters are pointing a few good things out :
<en=13>Clearly , the agency has worked hard at tackling the technical challenges posed by a superb and surprisingly independent - minded investigative panel .
<en=14>A few weeks ago , shuttle workers at the Kennedy Space Center received a rocket - like boost in morale with two important deliveries for the next shuttle to carry .
<en=15>One is a special tool to detect damage to the thermal - protective tile while in orbit - something the Columbia crew would have welcomed .
<en=16>The other is a new fuel tank " guaranteed " by NASA not to shed potentially fatal hunks of insulation .
<en=17>NASA has some PR hurdles to overcome in the future .
<en=18>But let s hope for their sake ( and the sake of all space lovers out there ) that they can redefine their image and rekindle the hope of space colonization again .
