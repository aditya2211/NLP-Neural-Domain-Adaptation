<en=5>He is regarded as one of the leading Avant - Garde artist of modern calligraphy .
<en=6>His artworks were selected and exhibited in British Museum in 2002 .
<en=7>" Wei has given some virtuoso performances with brush and ink , often incorporating several different techniques into a single work , " said Gordon S. Barrass , curator of the exhibition .
<en=8>In the world of " Wei 's magic cubes , " all seem to be ingeniously planned and tricky .
<en=9>All are mathematical , all are linguistic .
<en=10>In Wei 's art , a logician could see mathematical logic , a cellist could see a ripple of nine bass notes , a country girl could see straw , and Harry Potter could see two accompanied green blazes .
<en=11>" ... to gaze at Wei 's art is like entering a floating world of dreams . "
