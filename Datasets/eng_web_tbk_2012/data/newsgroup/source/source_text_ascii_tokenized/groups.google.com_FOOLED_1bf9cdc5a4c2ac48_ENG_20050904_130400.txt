<en=44>Excellent answer googlenut .
<en=45>Let me add some additional info .
<en=46>You can get details about NASA spending here , from their own webpage .
<en=47>Also , from their own webpage , reasons why NASA is important , in a 5th grade format .
<en=48>I guess if you are someone not familiar with how NASA benefits our society I can see how one might form the opinion of yheggy - ga .
<en=49>Let me put it this way - If you have watched TV recently , crossed a modern bridge , flown in an airplane , recieved any form of modern medicine , did any mathematics , drove a car , used a cellular phone , etc. then you have somehow directly reaped the rewards which NASA has returned to us .
<en=50>Also NASA has a large outreach program for education , some people believe this is important .
<en=51>Best , Steve .

<en=53>i believe that NASA is a HUGE waste of tax payers ' money , but there are so many huge wastes of tax payer monies , that i find it best not to think about it .
<en=54>i also think the National Endowment for the Arts is a waste , but i guess i would rather see my money go to the NEA than NASA .
<en=55>of course , in a perfect world , tax payers ' money would go toward some sort of national healthcare program , and housing for the homeless , but this is far from a perfect world .
<en=56>in response to Steve 's comment : do you really believe that spending trillions on space exploration over the years was the ONLY way to invent the cellfone ?
<en=57>and bridges ???
<en=58>i find that extremely hard to believe .
<en=59>i think it could have been done in a much more cost efficient way , right here on bad - old - planet - earth .
<en=60>just my two cents .
<en=61>thanks for listening .
