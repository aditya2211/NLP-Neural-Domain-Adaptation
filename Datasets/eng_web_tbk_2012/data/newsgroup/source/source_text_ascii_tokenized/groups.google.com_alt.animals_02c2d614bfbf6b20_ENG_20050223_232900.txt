<en=1>Blue Planet : Who 's afraid of Big Bad Wolf ?

<en=4>Boulder , CO , Feb. 23 ( UPI ) --
<en=5>Ever since he ate up Red Riding Hood 's grandma and blew down the houses of two - thirds of the Three Little Pigs , the Big Bad Wolf has held a persistently bad reputation .
<en=6>In part because of that reputation , the gray wolf was nearly exterminated from the lower 48 states by the 1920s , except for a small remnant population on Isle Royale National Park in Michigan 's Lake Superior .
<en=7>The last wolf was killed in Yellowstone National Park in 1943 .
<en=8>Western sheep and cattle ranchers , on whose behalf this extermination campaign was conducted , gratefully dusted their hands of the wolf and wrote him off as a job well done .
<en=9>Their sheep could graze , their cows could ruminate and never a discouraging word would be heard .
<en=10>After the major kill - offs , wolves outside of Alaska and Canada existed mostly as legend .
<en=11>Like UFOs or Sasquatch , several people claimed to see fleeting lone wolves , usually in Yellowstone .
<en=12>In the 1960s , a group shooting a movie in the Wyoming park reportedly imported some captive wolves , then released them when their shooting was done .
<en=13>If so , this happy band has not been heard from since .
<en=14>Rumor also had it some renegade biologist brought a caged pair to Yellowstone and released them into the wild sometime in the 1970s , hoping to reestablish a breeding population .
<en=15>If true , the caper failed .
<en=16>Over time , the wolf 's absence seemed to rehabilitate its image .
<en=17>Eventually , a trickle of support appeared for bringing the predator back to its former home range in the northern Rocky Mountains .
<en=18>This trickle grew into a flood , resulting in 14 wolves being reintroduced in Yellowstone in 1995 by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service -- albeit over the strong and still - continuing objections of ranchers .
<en=19>These wolf packs have flourished , and now there are an estimated 850 wolves roaming the northern Rockies , where merely 10 years ago there were none .
<en=20>One compelling argument for reintroduction was the wolf acts as a keystone predator , an animal that affects the populations , behavior and ecology of a wide variety of species within its range .
<en=21>Some recent research conducted by Oregon State University has given considerable credence to this idea .
<en=22>OSU forestry professors William Ripple and Robert Beschta have found that wolves actually promote stream - bank stabilization , although they have given the phenomenon the unfortunate name of " the ecology of fear " -- something that smacks of the horrible PR resulting from the wolf 's relationships with Riding Hood and the Three Pigs .
<en=23>They explained that elk in Yellowstone used to browse unmolested on young aspen and willow growing near the banks of streams , a behavior that prevented the saplings from reaching mature stages and increased the possibility of soil erosion .
<en=24>Since reintroduction , however , Ripple and Beschta have found , fear of the wolves apparently has discouraged the elk from spending too much time at stream banks -- where they are out in the open -- and munching on the saplings .
<en=25>" All you have to do is look at the photographs , " Ed Bangs , wolf recovery coordinator for the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service , told UPI 's Blue Planet ,
<en=26>" You say , ' wow ! '
<en=27>An area that used to be bald as a billiard ball is now a sea of willow . "
<en=28>This simple change has triggered a veritable ecological cascade in Yellowstone .
<en=29>More streamside willow and aspen have meant better habitat for beaver , for instance .
<en=30>Where there had been only one beaver colony in the park 's northern range before the wolves returned , now there are nine .
<en=31>" It may be uninteresting to a lot of people , " Beschta told Blue Planet .
<en=32>" There 's a lot of impact on plants and they say , ' Who cares ? '
<en=33>But we 've been looking at streamside communities .
<en=34>Since wolf recovery , streamside plants , willows and cottonwoods provide food for other critters -- beavers , a whole variety of avian species , berry - producing shrubs that bears can use .
<en=35>It 's important with regard to the quality of streams .
<en=36>The plants provide shade and root strength for bank stability .
<en=37>Plants are critical to wildland ecosystems . "
<en=38>Yellowstone has a vast elk herd , one of the largest in the world .
<en=39>Bangs said although the number of elk has not declined very much since the wolves came back , their behavior appears markedly different .
<en=40>" I 'm pretty suspicious of making broad generalizations , " however , he cautioned .
<en=41>" Wolves are still pretty new .
<en=42>They 've only been there for 10 years .
<en=43>In 10 more years we 'll have a better idea . "
<en=44>Wolf reintroduction in the northern Rockies has been so successful the Fish and Wildlife Service has moved to reduce the animal 's status from endangered to threatened and , eventually , to remove it from the endangered species list altogether .
<en=45>Bangs said the agency has established viable wolf packs in the northern Rockies , as required by federal regulations .
<en=46>Some conservationists want the protection extended so wolves can move into other states , including Colorado , Utah and Oregon , among others .
<en=47>On Jan. 31 , Oregon Federal District Court Judge Robert E. Jones appeared to agree with them .
<en=48>He vacated the FWS decision to downgrade the wolf 's status .
<en=49>Bangs said his agency is still reviewing the decision .
<en=50>Regardless of the wolf 's legal status , its future expansion into new areas now seems likely .
<en=51>Wolves can migrate considerable distances .
<en=52>A Yellowstone wolf was found dead , hit by a car , on a Colorado highway last year , several hundred miles from home .
<en=53>Meanwhile , his reputation seems to be improving , although Bangs noted a " pretty interesting social dynamic . "
<en=54>There are only about 850 wolves in the West , but there are an estimated 31,000 mountain lions .
<en=55>Pound for pound , mountain lions eat more game and more livestock than wolves .
<en=56>They even occasionally attack people , which wolves do not -- despite the propaganda from the Brothers Grimm .
<en=57>Yet people seem willing -- even eager -- to accommodate mountain lions , despite the risks .
<en=58>It remains to be seen whether they will extend the same courtesy to the arriving gray wolf .
<en=59>Regarding those rumors about wolves living in Yellowstone prior to the official reintroduction ?
<en=60>They seem to be just that : rumors .
<en=61>True , there are about 300,000 wolves and wolf hybrids kept as pets in the United States .
<en=62>It also is likely people have released some of these animals into the wild hoping they would survive -- for instance , a ranger in Glacier Park caught someone in this very act not long ago .
<en=63>Bangs said these animals are not equipped to survive in the wild , however , and they all almost certainly have died .
<en=64>He said after 10 years of DNA testing on northern Rockies wolves , scientists have not found a single strain that did not belong to one of the wolves the agency released -- or their descendants .
