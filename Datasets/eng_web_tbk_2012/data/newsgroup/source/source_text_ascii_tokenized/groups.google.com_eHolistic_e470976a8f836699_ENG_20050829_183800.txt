<en=1>Once upon a time ( in 2001 , to be specific ) , the Coca - Cola corporation built a bottling plant in a small and remote Indian village in the state of Kerala .
<en=2>In exchange for sucking vast amounts of water out of the local land , the mighty corporation promised to bring the people great wealth .
<en=3>But within a few short months , the village people began to notice their wells were running dry , so they complained to the corporation .
<en=4>Coca - Cola calmed the concerns of the people and attempted to win back their favor by giving them vast amounts of free fertilizer , saying it would grow bountiful crops beyond their wildest dreams .
<en=5>After several years of use , we arrive at the present day when the village people have suddenly discovered the fertilizer is actually the bottling plant 's waste sludge and is laden with cadmium , a highly toxic , cancer - causing heavy metal .
<en=6>The village soil and water are now too heavily contaminated to safely occupy human life , so the plant was shut down last week .
<en=7>Moral of the story : Do n't drink Coke .......... drink Pepsi !
<en=8>Just kidding , Pepsi is actually in the process of being thrown out of India for similar crimes , as well .
