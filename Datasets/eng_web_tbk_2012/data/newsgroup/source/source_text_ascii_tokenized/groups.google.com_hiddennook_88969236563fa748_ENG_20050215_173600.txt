<en=4>It looks like The Lunar Transportation Systems , Inc. is visualizing a " space highway " going from the moon to Earth ( and back again ) .
<en=5>" Our new lunar transportation system utilizes a unique architecture that will establish the equivalent of a two - way highway between the Earth and the Moon , " Kistler told SPACE.com .
<en=6>" Our plans include raising private capital to develop , build , flight test , and operate this Earth - Moon highway for the benefit of the country and the benefit of our investors . "
<en=7>Wise decision to go through the private sector -- NASA 's budget may be kinda tight to fund a project like this .
<en=8>This group does sound pretty interesting though .
<en=9>The Lunar Transporatation Systems ( LTS ) is actually being funded by two space businessmen , Walter Kistler and Bob Citron .
<en=10>Both of these men are heavily involved in the private sector of the space industry , and both are also involved with another space company called SPACEHAB .
<en=11>They want to use LTS to tie into NASA 's vision for Space Exploration , and seem pleased that the White House is moving in that direction .
<en=12>" We are so excited that the White House and the recent new government space policy underscores the need to involve the private sector in assisting NASA develop its plans for the new Vision for Space Exploration , " said Walter Kistler , LTS co-founder and Chairman .
<en=13>With their proposal of a " Earth - Moon " highway , it looks like space tourism may become a reality sooner than we think .
