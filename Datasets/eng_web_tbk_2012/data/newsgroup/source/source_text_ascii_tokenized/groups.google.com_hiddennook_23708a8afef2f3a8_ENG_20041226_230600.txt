<en=2>Normally this author is semi-objective ( what blogger is ) but on the Seattlepi.com ( see source link ) Palestinian Leader Mahmoud Abbas has demanded that Israel leave all the land that it occupies before the 1967 border ( which includes East Jerusalem by the way ) .
<en=3>One thing is certain for sure .
<en=4>If Abbas keeps up this " macho talk " he will kill potential peace talks and might as well allow Hamas ( which has probably done a better job at providing for the Palestinians ) rule the West Bank .

<en=6>Interim Palestinian leader and the front - runner in the upcoming Jan. 9 , 2005 presidential election Mahmoud Abbas talks during his first official campaign speech in the West Bank town of Ramallah , Saturday Dec. 25 , 2004 .
<en=7>Cloaking himself in Yasser Arafat 's legacy , Abbas pledged to fulfill Palestinian dreams of statehood .
<en=8>It seems that the Palestinian leadership ( upcoming ) will not be a peace partner with Israel .
<en=9>He is already demanding claims that Israel said no to not only the world , but to Arafat himself .
<en=10>Listing his priorities , Abbas told supporters of the ruling Fatah party that he was determined to provide security to his people and continue the struggle against Israel 's partially completed West Bank barrier .
<en=11>Abbas also pledged to resolve the problem of millions of Palestinian refugees and their descendants .
<en=12>Abbas , a refugee himself from what is today the northern Israeli city of Safed , called the refugee issue " very important and very dangerous . "
<en=13>Having personally visited the West Bank and Israel , I can say that this new political voice is threatening to collapse the peace process .
<en=14>If Abbas does not change his former thinking and continues the path of Yasser Arafat , then there will not be peace in the Holy Land and the Palestinians will ultimately suffer .
<en=15>Selah !
