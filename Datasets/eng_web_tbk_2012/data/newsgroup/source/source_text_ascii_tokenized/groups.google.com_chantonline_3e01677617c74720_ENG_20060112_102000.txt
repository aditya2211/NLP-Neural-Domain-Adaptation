<en=2>Hello there
<en=3>Action Network is a BBC website for people who are taking action on issues that concern them .
<en=4>I 'm getting in touch because I think it could be useful to people campaigning about hospital closures .
<en=5>We 've got a page dedicated to issues around hospitals ( http://www.bbc.co.uk/dna/actionnetwork/C55153 ) and a group called NHS SOS have already put up a campaign about ward closures in Cumbria .
<en=6>I 'm hoping to build this up to be a hub for all the campaigners - a place where people can exchange ideas and advice .
<en=7>It would be great if the person from CHANT who started this page would put up a short description of the campaign and a list to this group page on the Action Network site .
<en=8>Action Network is also a good place to post details of events , or try to rally together a group if you want to take action in your area .
<en=9>You can attach anything you write to pages for your local area , as well as to the ' issue ' pages .
<en=10>I 'm more than happy to help people with the site or answer any questions about Action Network - just drop me a message .
<en=11>Otherwise , hope to see you there !
<en=12>Kind regards
