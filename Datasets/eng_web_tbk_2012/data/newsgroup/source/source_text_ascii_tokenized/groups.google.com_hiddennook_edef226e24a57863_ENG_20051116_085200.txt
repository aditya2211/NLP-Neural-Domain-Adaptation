<en=3>NASA is looking to private companies to launch both supplies and astronauts to the International Space Station , it announced this week .
<en=4>[ ... ]
<en=5>" It 's not cost - effective doing station flights while at the same time focusing on getting back to the Moon , " says Brett Alexander , vice-president of Transformational Space , one of the companies hoping to launch astronauts to the ISS .
<en=6>NASA intends upon retiring the space shuttles in 2010 , which only leaves it with 18 flights towards the ISS .
<en=7>Outsourcing these responsibilities would be a wise alternative , considering the accomplishments of the private sector regarding the space elevator .
<en=8>Although some may praise this as an opportunity for the private sector to finally serve the public good , NASA seems hesitant about turning over the reigns to the corporate world .

<en=10>On 3 November , NASA administrator Michael Griffin told the US house science committee that the agency expects to invest about $ 500 million in the commercial cargo and crew project over five years .
<en=11>" That kind of a financial incentive [ ... ] will be sufficient to allow substantial providers to emerge , " Griffin said .
<en=12>" I hope that industry , if put to the test , can do better [ than the government ] , but I do not expect it , " Griffin added .
<en=13>Only time will reveal whether Griffin 's expectations are either exceeded or confirmed .
<en=14>But seeing how the private sector has been able to successfully transport civilians to the ISS ( at about a fifth of the cost ) , it would come to no surprise if corporate America was able to out perform their bureaucratic friends in government .
