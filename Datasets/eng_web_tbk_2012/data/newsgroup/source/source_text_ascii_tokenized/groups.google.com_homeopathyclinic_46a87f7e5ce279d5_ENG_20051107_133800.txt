<en=1>Several years ago I developed a short paper and pencil screening test which , in a small pilot study , discriminated between ADHD , LD , and control subjects .
<en=2>I recently converted this test to an online test in order to norm it to a larger population and , subsequently , to make it available to any one who has access to a computer and the Internet .
<en=3>The test itself is what is called a substitution test .
<en=4>It has two parts , both of which are timed for 90 seconds each and the differential between the resulting two scores determines the likelihood of having a learning disability or attention deficit disorder .
<en=5>I am in need of test subjects and hope you will take it .
<en=6>The test , along with an information form , is available at : .
<en=7>I think a test like this one is much needed .
<en=8>A person can take it directly instead of others completing behavioral checklists or a completing a lengthy program intensive test like TOVA .
<en=9>Perhaps you are willing to recommend this site and , if you have a website , place a link on your website .
