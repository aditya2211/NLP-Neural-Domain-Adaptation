<en=2>Inhibitory Systems Control the Pattern of Activity in the Cortex
<en=3>" Inhibitory systems are essential for controlling the pattern of activity in the cortex , which has important implications for the mechanisms of cortical operation , according to a Yale School of Medicine study in Neuron ....
<en=4>The findings demonstrate the inhibitory network is central to controlling not only the amplitude , extent and duration of activation of recurrent excitatory cortical networks , but also the precise timing of action potentials , and , thus , network synchronization ... "
