<en=4>HIGHLY CONFIDENTIAL URGENT ASSISTANCE - FROM USA
<en=5>FROM : GEORGE WALKER BUSH 202.456.1414 / 202.456.1111 FAX : 202.456.2461
<en=6>Dear Sir / Madam ,
<en=7>I am GEORGE WALKER BUSH , son of the former president of the United States of America George Herbert Walker Bush , and currently serving as President of the United States of America .
<en=8>This letter might surprise you because we have not met neither in person nor by correspondence .
<en=9>I came to know of you in my search for a reliable and reputable person to handle a very confidential business transaction , which involves the transfer of a huge sum of money to an account requiring maximum confidence .
<en=10>I am writing you in absolute confidence primarily to seek your assistance in acquiring oil funds that are presently trapped in the republic of Iraq .
<en=11>My partners and I solicit your assistance in completing a transaction begun by my father , who has long been actively engaged in the extraction of petroleum in the United States of America , and bravely served his country as director of the United States Central Intelligence Agency .
<en=12>In the decade of the nineteen - eighties , my father , then vice - president of the United States of America , sought to work with the good offices of the President of the Republic of Iraq to regain lost oil revenue sources in the neighboring Islamic republic of Iran .
<en=13>This unsuccessful venture was soon followed by a falling - out with his Iraqi partner , who sought to acquire additional oil revenue sources in the neighboring emirate of Kuwait , a wholly - owned U.S. - British subsidiary .
<en=14>My father re-secured the petroleum assets of Kuwait in 1991 at a cost of sixty - one billion U.S. dollars ( $ 61,000,000,000 ) .
<en=15>Out of that cost , thirty - six billion dollars ( $ 36,000,000,000 ) were supplied by King Hussein , Kingdom of Saudi Arabia and other Persian Gulf monarchies , and sixteen billion dollars ( $ 16,000,000,000 ) by German and Japanese partners .
<en=16>But my father 's former Iraqi business partner remained in control of the republic of Iraq and its petroleum reserves .
<en=17>My family is calling for your urgent assistance in funding the removal of the President of the Republic of Iraq and acquiring the petroleum assets of his country , as compensation for the costs of removing him from power .
<en=18>Unfortunately , our partners from 1991 are not willing to shoulder the burden of this new venture , which in its upcoming phase may cost the sum of 100 billion to 200 billion dollars ( $ 100,000,000,000 - $ 200,000,000,000 ) , both in the initial acquisition and in long - term management .
<en=19>Without the funds from our 1991 partners , we would not be able to acquire the oil revenue trapped within Iraq .
<en=20>That is why my family and our colleagues are urgently seeking your gracious assistance .
<en=21>Our distinguished colleagues in this business transaction include the sitting vice-president of the United States of America , Richard Cheney , who is an original partner in the Iraq venture and former head of the Halliburton oil company , and Condoleeza Rice , whose professional dedication to the venture was demonstrated in the naming of a Chevron oil tanker after her .
<en=22>I would beseech you to transfer a sum equaling ten to twenty - five percent ( 10 - 25 % ) of your yearly income to our account to aid in this important venture .
<en=23>The Internal Revenue Service of the United States of America will function as our trusted intermediary .
<en=24>I propose that you make this transfer before the fifteenth ( 15th ) of the month of April .
<en=25>I know that a transaction of this magnitude would make anyone apprehensive and worried .
<en=26>But I am assuring you that all will be well at the end of the day .
<en=27>A bold step taken shall not be regretted , I assure you .
<en=28>Please do be informed that this business transaction is 100 % legal .
<en=29>If you do not wish to co-operate in this transaction , please contact our intermediary representatives to further discuss the matter .
<en=30>I pray that you understand our plight .
<en=31>My family and our colleagues will be forever grateful .
<en=32>Please reply in strict confidence to the contact numbers below .
<en=33>Sincerely with warm regards ,
<en=34>George Walker Bush Switchboard : 202.456.1414 Comments : 202.456.1111 Fax : 202.456.2461 e-mail : presid...@whitehouse.gov
