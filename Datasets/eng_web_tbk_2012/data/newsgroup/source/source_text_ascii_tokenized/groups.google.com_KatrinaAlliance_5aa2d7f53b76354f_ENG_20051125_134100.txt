<en=1>The Greater New Orleans Fair Housing Action Center ( GNOFHAC ) filed a housing discrimination complaint against the Housing Authority of New Orleans ( HANO ) last week .
<en=2>The complaint , filed with the United States Department of Housing and Urban Development , accuses HANO of violating a 2003 enforcement agreement entered into between former St. Thomas Housing Development residents , the City of New Orleans , HANO , and the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development during the HOPE VI redevelopment of St. Thomas , now known as River Garden .
<en=3>The current complaints allege that HANO has not provided qualified former St. Thomas residents a preference with respect to available public housing units at River Garden per the 2003 agreement .
<en=4>Upon return to New Orleans after the Hurricane Katrina evacuation , former residents have been informed that there are no available public housing units at River Garden because those units have been reserved for HANO employees .
<en=5>Therefore , public housing residents have been unable to secure the units for which they qualified prior to the storm and are left homeless , as a result .
<en=6>" In the wake of Hurricane Katrina , affordable housing in New Orleans is more scarce than ever .
<en=7>As such , it is essential that HANO comply with 2003 enforcement agreement , " said James Perry , GNOFHAC Executive Director
