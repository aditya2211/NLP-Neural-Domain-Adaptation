<en=1>Dear Judges , Lawyers , Policemen , Guards , Counselors , Taxpayers , et. al. ,
<en=2>We are here .
<en=3>Like it or not , for good or bad , we are here .
<en=4>Who are we ?
<en=5>We are the downtrodden and dispossesed , the self - torturing , the disenfranchised convicts , drug and alcohol addicts , the unemployed and unemployable .
<en=6>We are the children of poverty , financial and spiritual .
<en=7>We have and will have children of our own , grandchildren too .
<en=8>We are ex-cons , uninsured , homeless , of many colors and speaking many tongues .
<en=9>We are the enemy in what has become a domestic war against ourselves .
<en=10>And who are you ?
<en=11>You who like the tough talk of Tough on Crime ?
<en=12>You who watch as budgets are cut in education and health care while you militarize a police force ?
<en=13>Bullet - proof vests , automatic weapons , helicopters , tanks , robots ... the testosterone is oozing through the streets , more prisons , longer sentences , tighten the belt , spartan conditions , task forces , gang units , gun courts .
<en=14>And what is there to show for it ?
<en=15>Unemployent stays low because half the population oversees those " out of the workforce " , the dregs , the rabble , the enemy ?
<en=16>Please tell me there is a deeper reason .
<en=17>Do you feel safer ?
<en=18>More humane ?
<en=19>More like a cohesive society with a shared sense of purpose , who can identify Us and Them ?
<en=20>Do you live in a gated community or gentrified neighborhood ?
<en=21>By the way , have you read the Declaration of Independence and US Constitution - or do you only know the first phrases ?
<en=22>It 's about time we got together .
<en=23>Please know that I have yet to meet a convict who wants their child to be a thief , an addict , a dealer , a prostitute , or a violent individual .
<en=24>Most of us still have hope for ourselves even when stuck in the darkest dilemmas , ruts and catch - 22s .
<en=25>Most of us believe in crafting laws and instilling order .
<en=26>Many of us have burrowed beneath the surface to find a spiritual sense of being , an understanding force at least as powerful as those we succumbed to , and many of use would n't escape if you opened the front door .
<en=27>Did you know that approximately 10 million Americans are either incarcerated , on probation , on parole or once were in those categories ?
<en=28>Each of those 10 million have families , friends , neighbors ... and so closer and closer does the We interface with the You .
<en=29>Do n't you think it 's time we talked ?
<en=30>Are you ready ?
<en=31>Can you accept that the road we are travelling points toward a grim and painful future ?
<en=32>Do you have the heart to face monumental failures while bravely struggling beyond where we are now ?
<en=33>I know that some of you are , and that some of us are , and this is what gives me hope .
<en=34>You need our insights just as we need your structure .
<en=35>It is never over , especially when a real solution , a real treatment for our sickness , is yet to begin .
<en=36>In Solidarity ,

<en=38>P.S. - I am trying to conceptualize an effective guerilla media campaign to promote this cause .
<en=39>Ideas are welcome .
<en=40>Collaboration is prayed .

<en=48>Subject : What is " food for the NSA line - eater " ?
