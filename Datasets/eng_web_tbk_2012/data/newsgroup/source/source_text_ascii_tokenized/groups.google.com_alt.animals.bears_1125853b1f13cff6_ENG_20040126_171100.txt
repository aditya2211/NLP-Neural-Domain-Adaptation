<en=1>MAKE THOUSANDS !!! --
<en=2>THIS IS NOT A SCAM !!!
<en=3>I found this on a bulletin board and decided to try it : I do n't care about the useless pre-fabricated crap this message usually says .
<en=4>All I say is , it works .
<en=5>Continue pre-fab crap .
<en=6>WELL GUESS WHAT !!!
<en=7>Within seven days , I started getting money in the mail !!
<en=8>I was shocked !!
<en=9>I figured it would end soon , but the money just kept coming in .
<en=10>In my first week , I made about $ 25.00 .
<en=11>By the end of the second week I had made a total of more than $ 1000.00 !!
<en=12>In the third week I had more than $ 10,000.00 and it 's still growing !!
<en=13>This is now my fourth week and I have made a total of $ 42,000.00 and it 's still coming rapidly .
<en=14>It 's certainly worth $ 6.00 and six stamps , and I have spent more than that on the lottery without ever winning !!!
<en=15>Let me tell you how this works and most important , why it works ..........
<en=16>also make sure you print this out NOW , so you can get the information off of it , as you will need it .
<en=17>I promise you that if you follow the directions exactly that you will start making more money than you thought possible by doing something so easy !!
<en=18>Suggestion : Read this entire message carefully !!
<en=19>( Print it out or download it )
<en=20>Follow the simple directions and watch the money come in !!
<en=21>It 's easy .
<en=22>It 's legal .
<en=23>And , your investment is only $ 6.00 ( Plus postage ) !!!
<en=24>IMPORTANT :
<en=25>This is not a rip - off , it is decent ; it 's legal ; and it is virtually no risk - it really works !!
<en=26>If all the following instructions are adhered to , you will receive extraordinary dividends .
<en=27>PLEASE NOTE :
<en=28>Please follow the directions EXACTLY , and $ 50,000 or more can be yours in 20 to 60 days .
<en=29>This program remains successful because of the honesty and integrity of the participants .
<en=30>Please continue its success by carefully adhering to the instructions .
<en=31>You will now become a part of the Mail Order business .
<en=32>You are in the business of developing Mailing Lists .
<en=33>Many large corporations are happy to pay big bucks for quality lists .
<en=34>However , the money made from the mailing lists is secondary to income which is made from people like you and me asking to be included in that list .
<en=35>Here are the four easy steps to success .
<en=36>STEP ONE :
<en=37>Get six separate pieces of paper and write the following on each piece of paper " PLEASE PUT ME ON YOUR MAILING LIST . "
<en=38>Now get 6 U.S. $ 1.00 bills and place ONE inside of EACH of the six pieces of paper so the bill will not be seen through the envelope ( to prevent thievery ) .
<en=39>Next , place one paper in each of the six envelopes and seal them .
<en=40>You now should have six sealed envelopes , each with a piece of paper stating the above phrase , your name and address , and a $ 1.00 bill .
<en=41>What you are doing is creating a service .
<en=42>THIS IS ABSOLUTELY LEGAL !!!! !
<en=43>You are requesting a legitimate service and you are paying for it !!
<en=44>Like most of us I was a little skeptical and little worried about the legal aspects of it all .
<en=45>So I checked it out with the U.S. Post Office ( 1-800-238-5355 ) and they confirmed that it is indeed legal !!
<en=46>Mail the six envelopes to the following addresses :
<en=47>1 ) G. Burrows 1 / 264 Tor St Toowoomba QLD 4350 Australia
<en=48>2 ) S Luest P.O. Box 366 Garden Grove , CA 92842 USA
<en=49>3 ) G. V. & A. Bourret 41 Broome St , # 1 Brooklyn , NY 11222 USA
<en=50>4 ) R. Ansems Gen. Foulkesstraat 5 4641 BW Ossendrecht Netherlands
<en=51>5 ) W. Brumbley 4632 Hilton Ave Suite # 31 Columbus , Ohio 43228
<en=52>STEP TWO : Now take the # 1 name off the list that you see above , move the other names up ( six becomes 5 , 5 becomes 4 , and etc. ) and add YOUR NAME as number 6 on the list .
<en=53>STEP THREE :
<en=54>Change anything you need to but try to keep this article as close to original as possible .
<en=55>Now post your amended article to at least 200 news groups . :
<en=56>( I think there are close to 24,000 groups )
<en=57>All you need is 200 , but remember , the more you post , the more money you make !!
<en=58>This is perfectly legal !!
<en=59>If you have any doubts , refer to Title 18 Sec. 1302 & 1341 of the Postal Lottery laws .
<en=60>Keep a copy of these steps for yourself and whenever you need money , you can use it again , and again .
<en=61>PLEASE REMEMBER that this program remains successful because of the honesty and integrity of the participants and by their carefully adhering to directions .
<en=62>Look at it this way .
<en=63>If you were of integrity , the program will continue and the money that so many others have received will come your way .
<en=64>NOTE : You may want to retain every name and address sent to you , either on a computer or hard copy and keep the notes people send you .
<en=65>This VERIFIES that you are truly providing a service .
<en=66>( Also , it might be a good idea to wrap the $ 1 bill in dark paper to reduce the risk of mail theft ) .
<en=67>So , as each post is downloaded and the directions carefully followed , all members will be reimbursed for their participation as a List Developer with one dollar each .
<en=68>Your name will move up the list geometrically so that when your name reaches the # 1 position you will be receiving thousands of dollars in CASH !!!
<en=69>What an opportunity for only $ 6.00 ( $ 1.00 for each of the first six people listed above )
<en=70>Send it now , add your own name to the list and you 're in business !!!
