<en=3>I 'm a member of a local animal rights news , and get regular emails from other members and the staff .
<en=4>Recently , I read an email that reported the horrific nightmare Civet Cats go through by sick losers who put them in sheds and heat the inside of the sheds up to 110 degrees with fires , so that they can periodically scrape the sweat off of their genitals and sell it to corrupt corporations who use it to prolong the scent of perfumes .
<en=5>The animals eventually die , which is because these demons are so GREEDY , they want as much of their " product " as they can get , instead of letting the cats go after a point , as an act of humanity , mercy , love .
<en=6>Below I pasted the email text , and it has a link to a website that automatically plays this song the author of the email created .
<en=7>It has cat 's " Meowing " for the vocals , and you might really find yourself in those furnaces , feeling and thinking those terrible feelings and thoughts that these cats do before they die .
<en=8>Right now , while we 're sitting at our computers enjoying the internet , those innocent , beautiful , loving cats , are dying , somewhere in this troubled world a slow , agonizing death .
<en=9>The main reason I wrote this post is to ask anyone reading this if they know of some way I can help put a stop to this Cat Holocaust .
<en=10>I am serious about doing something .
<en=11>If I love cats so much , why are n't I DOING something ???
<en=12>I do n't want to appear before God on judgment day and have to explain why I did n't do anything like this in my life .
<en=13>Any suggestions would be appreciated .
<en=14>Here 's the text of the email :
<en=15>Hi there ,
<en=16>I read the Civet Cat story from a little while ago , and tonight , when my Mom emailed me about it , I re-read it , and went to the website with the song the author of the email created .
<en=17>Well , sure enough , when I heard the cats " Meowing , " I imagined the hellish moments these poor beautiful creatures of God were living , what went on in their tiny , sweet little minds , and decided that I want to do something about this torture .
<en=18>So , if anyone can give me some advice , I 'd sure appreciate it !
<en=19>I think for starters , myself and those of you who believe in God could say a special prayer for them .
<en=20>I will .
<en=21>I 've pasted the email for those who have n't seen or would like to re-read it .
<en=22>It 's also got the website where the song has been uploaded .
<en=23>I was thinking , that while I 'm sitting here , relaxing and enjoying myself , those poor innocent animals are being cooked to death with heat in those Holocaust-esque death chambers .
<en=24>And what am I DOING about it ?

<en=28>Subject : Civet Cats , James Rachels + a song
<en=29>This is my first time posting to the list , so I feel somewhat embarrassed by " promoting " a song I wrote , but I think it is fitting because it is directly tied to extreme animal suffering as a result of human lack of empathy , but an abundance of human greed .
<en=30>I 'm not sure if any of you know much about civet cats , but to brief those who might not know , I will quote James Rachels , author of World Hunger and Moral Obligation among many other animal rights - related books and articles .
<en=31>( I kind of see him to be for animal rights theory as Peter Singer is to the theory of utilitarianism applied to non-human animals ) .
<en=32>The quote is from an article entitled " Vegetarianism and ` The Other Weight Problem ' "
<en=33>If anyone wants the complete article , email me , as it is a very good article which no meat - eater can read and not sense their own hypocrisy .
<en=34>But this is what he says about civet cats :
<en=35>" As an example , consider the treatment of the civet cat , a highly intelligent and sociable animal .
<en=36>Civet cats are trapped and placed in small cages inside darkened sheds , where the temperature is kept up to 110 F by fires .
<en=37>They are confined in this way until they finally die .
<en=38>What justifies this extraordinary mistreatment ?
<en=39>These animals have the misfortune to produce a substance that is useful in the manufacture of perfume .
<en=40>Musk , which is scraped from their genitals once a day for as long as they can surv ive , makes the scent of perfume last a bit longer after each application .
<en=41>( The heat increases their " production " of musk . )
<en=42>Here Kant 's rule -- " Animals are merely means to an end ; that end is man " -- is applied with a vengeance .
<en=43>To promote one of the most trivial interests we have , thousands of animals are tormented for their whole lives . "
<en=44>This article , and specifically this piece , effected me enough to try to build a song around the topic .
<en=45>If anyone is interested in listening to this song , and in offering their opinion , whether it be positive or negative , I 'd appreciate it .
<en=46>But I also hope no one feels any obligation to download , especially if you have an internet connection as slow mine ( 28 k ) .
<en=47>The url for the song is http://www.sonic.net/~fsjob/TragiCore-TheCivetCat.mp3
<en=48>Although there are no human vocals / lyrics , I think it's subject matter is audible .
<en=49>Again , if anyone wants to read Rachels ' entire article , let me know .
<en=50>It 's also on the net .
<en=51>I was already a vegetarian when I read it a little more than a year ago , but it was one of the bigger factors for me in going completely vegan .
<en=52>I hope all are well .
<en=53>Farewell for now ...
