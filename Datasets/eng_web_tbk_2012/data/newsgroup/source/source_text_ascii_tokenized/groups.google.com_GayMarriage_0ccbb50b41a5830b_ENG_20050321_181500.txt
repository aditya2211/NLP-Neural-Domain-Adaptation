<en=1>NORTH CAROLINA RELIGIOUS COALITION FOR MARRIAGE EQUALITY
<en=2>From what we hear from the news media , one could easily conclude that all Christians are opposed to gay marriage .
<en=3>But that 's not the case .
<en=4>Last year an organization named the North Carolina Religious Coalition for Marriage Equality was formed to get out the message that at least some people of faith are not opposed to extending the rights and responsibilities of civil marriage to same - gender couples .
<en=5>One of " NCRC4ME 's " major efforts is to collect signatures for the attached " Declaration of Religious Leaders , " which has been and will again be presented to members of the NC legislature .
<en=6>It presents the case for marriage equality and states , " We are resolved that the State should not interfere with same - gender couples who choose to marry and share fully and equally in the rights , responsibilities , and commitments of civil marriage . "
<en=7>A measure to amend the NC Constitution to ban gay marriage was defeated last year but already has been reintroduced in the 2005 legislative session , so there is a real need for visible support for the " pro-same - gender - marriage " side of this issue .
<en=8>At its February meeting the CHS Vestry voted unanimously to add their names to the Declaration .
<en=9>Our Rector Barbara and our Deacon Clare also have signed the Declaration .
<en=10>Furthermore , the Vestry voted unanimously to invite the support of members of the CHS congregation for the Declaration .
<en=11>( Since the Declaration is written as coming from " religious leaders , " people who do n't consider themselves " religious leaders " can sign as " Supporters of the North Carolina Religious Coalition for Marriage Equality . " )
<en=12>Please note that the Declaration addresses only civil marriage ; it says nothing about religious beliefs or practices regarding marriage .
<en=13>If you have any questions please feel free to call me ( after Sat. the 26th , when I will return from a trip ) .
<en=14>Sign - up lists will be available at the services on Feb. 27 and March 6 , or you can email me .
<en=15>I will email names and email addresses ( or postal addresses ) of signers to NCRC4ME in time for their " lobby day " in Raleigh on March 15 .
<en=16>Thank you for your consideration of this issue .
<en=17>For the Church of the Holy Spirit Vestry ,

<en=20>North Carolina Religious Coalition for Marriage Equality Declaration of Religious Leaders April 19 , 2004
<en=21>The most fundamental human right , after the necessities of food , clothing and shelter , is the right to affection and the supportive love of other human beings .
<en=22>We become most fully human when we love another person .
<en=23>We can grow in our capacity to be human - to be loving - in a family unit .
<en=24>This right to love and form a family is so fundamental that our United States Constitution takes it for granted in its dedication to " secure the blessings of liberty to ourselves and our posterity . "
<en=25>The North Carolina Constitution likewise affirms the " inalienable rights " of human beings to " life , liberty , the enjoyment of the fruits of their own labor , and the pursuit of happiness . "
<en=26>Throughout history , tyrants have known that by denying the right of oppressed peoples to form and nurture families , they can kill the spirit of those peoples .
<en=27>> From the shameful history of slavery in America , the injustice of forbidding people to marry is evident as a denial of a basic human right .
<en=28>The American laws forbidding interracial marriage , now struck down , were clearly discriminatory .
<en=29>Denial of the status of marriage to those who would freely accept its responsibilities creates legal and economic inequities and social injustice .
<en=30>We feel called to protest and oppose this injustice .
<en=31>As religious people , clergy and lay leaders , we are mandated by faith to stand for justice in our common civic life .
<en=32>We oppose the use of sacred texts and religious traditions to deny legal equity to same - gender couples .
<en=33>As concerned citizens we affirm the liberty of adults of the same gender to love and marry .
<en=34>We insist that no one , especially the state , is allowed to coerce people into marriage or bar two consenting adults , whether of the same or differing genders , from forming the family unit that lets them be more fully loving , thus more fully human .
<en=35>We respect the fact that debate and discussion continue in many of our religious communities as to the scriptural , theological and liturgical issues involved .
<en=36>However , we draw on our many faith traditions to arrive at a common conviction .
<en=37>We are resolved that the State should not interfere with same - gender couples who choose to marry and share fully and equally in the rights , responsibilities , and commitments of civil marriage .
<en=38>We affirm freedom of conscience in this matter .
<en=39>We recognize that the state may not require religious groups to officiate at , or bless , same - gender marriages .
<en=40>Likewise , a denial of state civil recognition dishonors the religious convictions of those communities and clergy who officiate at , and bless , same - gender marriages .
<en=41>The state may not favor the convictions of one religious group over another by denying individuals their fundamental right to marry and to have those marriages recognized by civil law .
<en=42>As faith leaders , we commit ourselves to public action , visibility , education , and mutual support in the service of the right and freedom to marry .
