<en=4>The Palestinian militant organisation Hamas has announced an end to rocket attacks on Israel from the Gaza Strip after a weekend of escalating violence .
<en=5>Up to 40 rockets had been fired at Israel , weeks after its military withdrew from the territory .
<en=6>In response to the rockets , Israel resumed its policy of targeting militant leaders in air strikes .
<en=7>Authorised by Ariel Sharon to make " unrestricted " strikes , its military launched new missile attacks overnight .
<en=8>It looks as if Hamas has thrown in the towel for this round , unable to take the beating the Israeli Defense Forces have unleashed upon this terrorist group .
<en=9>Mahmoud Zahar , Hamas 's leader declared the cease fire after Israel killed it's former leader , Muhammed Sheikh Khalil .
<en=10>Hamas has become rather unpopular in Gaza , as many see the Israeli air strikes as a response towards the rocket attacks upon Israeli soil .
<en=11>Egypt had a role to play as they convinced Hamas to end the attacks , although the same can not be said of Islamic Jihad .
<en=12>( Jerusalem Post )
<en=13>" We 're not happy with Hamas 's position at this stage and in light of the Israeli escalation against the Palestinians , " commented Khader Habib , a senior Islamic Jihad official .
<en=14>" But it seems that Hamas has its own political agenda . "
<en=15>[ ... ]
<en=16>" The problem is not with the Palestinian resistance groups but with Israel 's scheme to destroy the Palestinians ' infrastructure , " Habib said .
<en=17>" Hamas remains targeted by Israel , as in the past , and the Israeli occupation does not need excuses to pursue its aggression .
<en=18>Israel wants to drive the Palestinians toward civil war . "
<en=19>Islamic Jihad has refused to recognized the cease fire , and hopes to turn the Gaza strip " into a vast battlefield . "
<en=20>Unless President Mahmoud Abbas steps in , Gaza will probably look like a battle field by the time Israel is done reminding Hamas of their critical error , although currently the only thing Abbas is doing is lashing out and refusing to take responsibility for his inability to act .
