<en=1>Hi all ,
<en=2>There are already several forums around the net focused on discussing Guild Wars , so why create a new one ?
<en=3>I say why not ?
<en=4>The main reason is Google is more accessible to the global community and you can rest assured that it 's not going to go away .
<en=5>I have seen great fan sites suddenly disappear without notice and for no reason .
<en=6>Usually this happens because the developer of the site can no longer afford the cost of bandwidth being used .
<en=7>That said , the maintenance of this forum is handled by Google and thus will remain reliable and it will ultimately give us more time to play :) .
<en=8>I 'm nothing more than a devoted fan of the game myself and I hope that this area can become a haven for deep fan discussions .
<en=9>Regards ,
<en=10>Humanpixel
<en=11>Aye !
<en=12>Good Day Mate !
<en=13>I m really looking forward to Guild Wars .
<en=14>Anyone know a release date ?
<en=15>Feb 2005
<en=16>Feb 2005 is the projected release date , although Guild Wars is made by ex-members of Blizzard , so Feb 2005 could mean August 2006 ...
<en=17>Anyway , I tried to get a preorder but no places were selling it so I missed out on 2/3 weekend events .
<en=18>Oh well , I 'll get it when it comes out in Febuary .
<en=19>rumor has feb 05 on the calender .
<en=20>BUT they stated that they will take as long as it takes to work out all the bugs so who really know how long .
<en=21>as far as pre order go to and they have a list of major retailers that carry it there are also a few websites that you could order it off of .
<en=22>and a good reason for starting this group .... company firewalls lol ;)
<en=23>I was kind of curious , what exactly is Guild Wars ?
<en=24>I hav n't heard of it .
<en=25>Check out the Guild Wars Web site at for more info about the game .
<en=26>It 's a massive multiplayer role playing game .
<en=27>The graphics are without a doubt the amoung the best graphics I have ever seen for any game and I have been gaming since the MUD days .
<en=28>It 's worth a look .
<en=29>I have a preorder and am even considering getting a second preorder to have multiple accounts .
<en=30>I have participated in all the weekend beta events and the world preview .
<en=31>The game is already 100 % functional .
<en=32>I ca n't imagine them not being able to meet the Feb 05 deadline .
<en=33>Warm greetings to all in this GW community .
<en=34>I am Lady Kingel and I hail from the United Legit Gaming Guilds of Guild Wars .
<en=35>We are a consortium of legit honorable guilds that was established in 1997 for DI and we are now adding GW to the list of games played .
<en=36>The alliance is a pretty straightforward one .
<en=37>It was formed to allow many different guilds who were all strictly honorable to come together as a family and allow them many people to game with .
<en=38>There are no other requirements other than we ask that members greet each new member and each new alliance and also feel free to post in any of the forums .
<en=39>We are also a group who is looking for members for our own select guild called ULGG of GW ... which is a part of the alliance with the same name .
<en=40>We play in all aspects of the game and we hand pick our members .
<en=41>I would like to personally invite each of you to visit our website .
<en=42>You are individuals of quality , and in our alliance we seek quality of member over quantity of member .
<en=43>You will be asked to register , and then you should wander over to the Announce Your Arrival Section and present yourself .
<en=44>You will be greeted by many members of this wonderful family .
<en=45>I do hope to see you visiting us at the fire and we shall prepare a feast for you , as well .
<en=46>If you paste this in your browser , it will take you directly to our GW website .
<en=47>I extend my hand to each of you in true friendship , and honor .
<en=48>Come and say hello ... you will be warmly welcomed !
<en=49>We are currently moving to a new server , so we will be down for a while .
<en=50>I will inform when we are up and running again .
<en=51>I wish all happy holidays , and moreso , peace on earth .
<en=52>Kingel
