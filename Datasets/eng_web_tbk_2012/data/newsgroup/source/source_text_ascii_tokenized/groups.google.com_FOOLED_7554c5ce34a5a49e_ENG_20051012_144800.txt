<en=1>NASA & Company Diplomacy - Trying to keep Moon Landing Hoax a secret in modern times
<en=2>Some strategies being used by NASA & Company in relation to China and other space planning countries are mentioned here after being gleaned from a news item underneath .
<en=3>Country has an Independent strategy = NASA & company to use " Numero Uno " strategy , try to assert , beat , mesh and control the space program of the country .
<en=4>This can also be through political , economical , social , and technological influence .
<en=5>Country not open or not have fixed strategy = NASA & Company to use " freeze thawed " strategy especially when the country has a challenging , growing and ambitious space program .
<en=6>This can also be through political , economical , social , and technological influence .
<en=7>Dependant = NASA & Company to use " space station " model to unify the aims of different countries .
<en=8>This is really an end goal aim of NASA & Company and also does not allow anyone challenging the moon landing hoax .
<en=9>The target for NASA & Company probably to get by 2018 all the ambitious space program countries shifting towards this model , through the propaganda of another moon mission ; deliberately failing this or trying hard for another moon landing hoax ; achieving the real aim of space unity between space programs of other countries .

<en=11>Secretive efforts keep outsiders in the dark about the program 's goals

<en=15>China launched Shenzhou VI , its second manned spacecraft , early today in northwest China 's Gansu Province .
<en=16>A pair of military pilots embarked on China 's second manned space flight early today , hurtling into orbit on a test mission that could span five days .
<en=17>The crew of the Shenzhou VI spacecraft was identified as Fei Junlong , 40 , and Nie Haishen , 41 , by China 's official news agency .
<en=18>The successful launch from the Jiuquan Satellite Launch Center in northwest China follows the solo flight of Yang Liwei in October 2003 .
<en=19>His one - day mission vaulted his communist homeland into the elite circle of spacefaring nations - Russia and the United States - that can launch and sustain humans in space .
<en=20>Most experts believe China intends to develop a small space station of its own over the next several years .
<en=21>But they remain uncertain about whether China aims to beat the United States to the moon in its secretive space effort .
<en=22>President Bush has directed NASA to return to the moon by 2018 with a new generation of human explorers .
<en=23>China 's " is not a fly - by - night program , " said Joan Johnson - Freese , an expert on national security who follows space developments in the Asian nation at the Naval War College in Newport , R.I .
<en=24>" They are not in any hurry .
<en=25>They want a program that will be a success , " Johnson - Freese said .
<en=26>" They are not going to rush it , because they do n't want it to be a budget buster .
<en=27>Economics will be a big determiner in the speed of their program . "
<en=28>China 's overtures to join the U.S. - led effort to develop the 16 - nation international space station have been thwarted for more than a decade over a range of issues , including the Asian country 's human rights policies and worries it could acquire technologies that could pose a security threat .
<en=29>The freeze thawed some after Yang 's 2003 mission .
<en=30>China was among 30 nations invited to send a delegate to NASA - sponsored roundtable discussions on Bush 's strategy to reach the moon with astronauts as the first step in the exploration of Mars and other - deep space destinations .
<en=31>" We applaud China 's space achievements , " NASA spokesman Allard Beutel said Tuesday .
<en=32>" We wish them a successful return of their astronauts . "
<en=33>He stressed , however , that NASA would not follow this week 's Chinese mission through formal channels .
<en=34>At present , there are no plans for additional meetings with foreign powers to discuss the Bush exploration initiative or to extend an invitation to China to join the space station partnership , Beutel said .
<en=35>The flight of Fei and Nie could mark the end of the opening chapter in a three - phase Chinese space initiative , Johnson - Freese said .
<en=36>The first phase , she said , will demonstrate the capability of a multi-compartment spacecraft that will leave a test module in orbit when the two fliers return to Earth .
<en=37>The Chinese program 's second phase will include spacewalks on future missions and demonstrations of docking and undocking techniques .
<en=38>The final phase will feature the assembly and operation of a longer - duration space lab .
<en=39>At least one expert believes China 's intentions might include a surprise attempt to circle the moon with astronauts before NASA 's planned lunar return .
<en=40>" The Americans would be wise to plan accordingly , " said John E. Pike , director of the Alexandria , Va. - based GlobalSecurity.org , a small national security think tank .
<en=41>" There is always the possibility they could jam us up , make us look like we are not numero uno , " Pike said .
<en=42>During the U.S. and Russian lunar race during the Cold War , NASA scored an early coup by circling the moon with the Apollo 8 crew over the 1968 Christmas holidays .
<en=43>As it turned out , the Soviets never made it to the moon .
<en=44>" ( China ) could be the second country to do that , " Pike said .
<en=45>" They would get in line in front of the Russians .
<en=46>And they would not have to land on the moon to take us down a notch . "
<en=47>Pike 's concern is based on China 's development of a new medium - lift rocket , the Long March V , and the construction of a new space launch complex on Hainan Island in the South China Sea .
<en=48>The two developments , he said , could eventually enable China 's space program to mature to the point that experts could assemble and launch from Earth 's orbit a spacecraft capable of circling the moon with astronauts and returning home .
