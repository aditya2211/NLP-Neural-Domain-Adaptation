<en=6>Relief agencies are trying to help hundreds of thousands of displaced people while authorities have vowed to restore security in New Orleans following a breakdown of law and order .
<en=7>In the world press , commentators predict that Katrina will make a profound change in the way the US is perceived at home and abroad , especially following the scenes of poverty and racial divisions they believe the disaster has revealed .
<en=8>Meanwhile , President George W Bush has said he will lead an inquiry into how the disaster was handled .

<en=14>Some of the better comments :
<en=15>" As an American , I would like to take this opportunity to tell all the ' USA and Bush Bashers ' that I am appalled at the number of ' allies ' that are using this disaster as their podium to spread their useless opinions .
<en=16>What you see in New Orleans is a perfect example of the downfalls of the welfare system , a form of socialism that many in this country know is the true problem .
<en=17>You have seen the pictures .
<en=18>You people think it is race , but it is not .
<en=19>It is the welfare society that was New Orleans . "
<en=20>-- Paul , Atlanta , USA
<en=21>" I am frankly revolted by the response of the Bush - Bashers ; " Sorry chaps , but you did have it coming ... "
<en=22>The plain fact is that Bush has a sight more in the way of common humanity than a great many of his detractors .
<en=23>At least he is n't using this disaster for cheap political point - scoring . "
<en=24>-- Mac , Nottingham
<en=25>" I do not feel it has changed the US citizens which is what was needed , even now the majority want " Gas " despite the fact they are polluting the world more than any other country in the world and refuse to stop , perhaps this natural disaster , which let 's face it looks like a product of Global Warming , will change their views , why not pick things up with your hands and walk with your legs , other people in the world do it , " Gas " is not the be all and end all ! "
<en=26>-- David , Kent
<en=27>< This man has clearly never visited the US .
<en=28>Distances are not what they are in the old world .
<en=29>Here , cars are absolutely necessary , and he 'd have to have one , too .
<en=30>- Juggernaut >
<en=31>" The US will work its way through the loss of a city and we are making progress after seven short days .
<en=32>Thank you for your concern , but Europe is still irrelevant . "
<en=33>-- John B , Windermere , Florida
<en=34>< John can come over to eat at my house anytime .
<en=35>- Juggernaut >
<en=36>It is always interesting what spin the press will take .
<en=37>Certainly , representation of the US in other countries will have a certain depiction .
<en=38>I do n't believe that folks who believe that America is the land of opportunity will change their views from this recent news .
<en=39>I have a friend who came here from Bulgaria after winning a green card in a lottery .
<en=40>Yes , she and her family were delighted to leave the communistic remnants in that country .
<en=41>Her husband became a citizen of the US just the week before last .
<en=42>( Believe it or not , it takes a minimum of 5 years to apply . )
<en=43>The countries which are giving to America to aid are a great example of the seed that America has sown through the years with other nations .
<en=44>Now to the poverty stricken and the racial issue ...
<en=45>You know , I 've lived in the Dallas / Fort Worth Metroplex most of my life .
<en=46>When not in Texas , I lived in LA and San Francisco .
<en=47>There is a lot of racial diversity in all of these places ... and I 've vacationed through the south ... visited my folks when they lived in Mississippi , and where they live now and are in the racial minority being white ( less than 20 % ) in northeastern Arkansas .
<en=48>The fact is , when I began traveling for business to New England , when I first visited my in - laws in Montana and Idaho , I was shocked at the lack of racial diversity .
<en=49>I did n't expect to react that way , but when I was looking around my workplace in Nashua , New Hampshire , and everyone else looked pretty much like me , it was really very eerie .
<en=50>So , yes , America has pockets that are more diverse than others .
<en=51>Additionally , reviewing the standings of Louisiana and Mississippi in the educational stakes , you 'll find they usually land near the bottom of a list of 50 states .
<en=52>Unfortunately , those left behind to be filmed , where those without transportation or means .
<en=53>Some refused to leave , but so many were unable to .
<en=54>Yes , it 's a valid reflection of America - we do have cities like this .
<en=55>However , New Orleans also had many affluent people , people who left town early as they had the means .
<en=56>I do n't know if this will change other nation 's perceptions of America .
<en=57>I suspect it will not change greatly ... but you never know how much stock people put in the news .
<en=58>I do know that this will change the face of America .
<en=59>I expect that many of the displaced people ( those affluent and those not ) will remain in the places they were evacuated to .
<en=60>The 1.25 million people who have been housed in stadiums and convention centers across Texas will begin to populate Houston , Dallas , San Antonio and Galveston , and the surrounding areas .
<en=61>Sure , some will return , but I have a feeling that once many begin to get jobs and temporary housing , they may be shy about returning .
<en=62>I 'm interested in what America will look like in 5 years .
<en=63>Will racial diversity find its way to Wyoming as some people are offered jobs there ?
<en=64>Or will the nearly year - round snow be too much for those who have never experienced snow in their lives ?
<en=65>Will the housing market in Dallas begin booming like the rest of the nation has due to the influx of buyers ?
<en=66>Will businesses that were new in 2005 have become a household name due to their efforts in rebuilding the gulf coast ?
<en=67>What will the federal government do to prevent inflation in the housing and building market ?
<en=68>These are some of the things I 've been wondering ...
<en=69>Linna
<en=70>Response coming soon .
<en=71>Your reply is good and deserves something good in return .
<en=72>Juggernaut
<en=73>Okay , I 'm new to this forum and really do n't like Bush , so my view point is slanted and I admit that .
<en=74>I rarely listen to the news or to what politicians or lawyers say because so many tell lies that none have credibility so what 's the point ?
<en=75>What I know is that I have a close friend who's aunt disappeared in New Orleans .
<en=76>My friend did n't have computer capability , so I spent the day searching and posting online .
<en=77>The family here ( California ) wanted to fly any family members from there to CA , so they could remain here until things got straightened out down there .
<en=78>The cousins could not be found because no one was sure of their married names .
<en=79>The hope was that anyone looking for the Aunt would see the family post and know that help was available .
<en=80>It is Oct. 6 , and not one family member has been located .
<en=81>What I saw was dozens of school buses submerged that could have been used to evacuate people who had no transportation .
<en=82>What I heard was the Mayor of New Orleans , saying that he did n't order the buses or anything else to be used because he was waiting on someone else to tell him what to do .
<en=83>When common sense takes a back seat to politics and legal mumbo jumbo what have we become ?
<en=84>Recently , Bush addressed the nation .
<en=85>About 30 seconds into his address , he started flogging the terrorist issue just one more time .
<en=86>Ironically he almost burst out laughing and it was all he could do to keep his mirth down to a barely controlled smirk .
<en=87>Even he ca n't believe that he is trotting out this old saw again .
<en=88>I guess if you have a schtick that is a resounding success once , you ca n't help but trot it out every time your act is going sour .
<en=89>Meanwhile , every pocket that can be lined is golden and the poor are shunted off radar yet again .
<en=90>The gall of it all is that Bush is stumping for more money to build more refineries , when what he should do is pour money into making the US independent of OPEC or crude oil all together .
<en=91>We have the technology ; if you are going to spend billions of dollars touting " FREEDOM " why not spend those billions making all of us free ?
<en=92>Free of polution , free of oil dependency , and free of big business that is bleeding us dry for the short term good ( theirs ) .
<en=93>I 'm sorry he makes me want to puke so I shut him off .
<en=94>In the meanwhile there are still broken families that should have been safe in the home of the brave .
