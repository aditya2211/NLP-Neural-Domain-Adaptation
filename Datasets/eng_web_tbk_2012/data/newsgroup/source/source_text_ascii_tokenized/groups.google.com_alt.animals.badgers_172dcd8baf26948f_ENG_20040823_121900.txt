<en=1>the industry of Marriage and Kids , you heard me .
<en=2>Marriage is , in and of itself , a noble concept , but it too often leads to kids and kids flat out suck .
<en=3>How can I say such an abomination , ask you ?
<en=4>Look around you and notice all the mind numbing trailor trash cretins out there who should not be procreating , yet they do .
<en=5>These are the people who keep Jerry springer on the air .
<en=6>These are the kids who will destroy society , because of the crapfest the American family has become under the post hippie culture , you heard again .
<en=7>And you might think by reading this I blame the kids .....
<en=8>Not so , Kids are what kids are and will do what they do .
<en=9>It is literally monkey see and monkey do with them .
<en=10>That will likely never change .
<en=11>It 's the bad parents out there who fuck up their lives and do nt seem to understand that once you decide to have kids , it is indeed time to grow up and be a responsible role model for those kids .
<en=12>Very few parents do this .
<en=13>And this is a direct result of the Politically correct , permissive , time out granting bullshit liberal culture that has caused this .
<en=14>When you blame it all on society , there 's noone to to take responsibility and all of a sudden you have generation of fucked up kids who are likley smoking , drinking , doing drugs , fucking the neighbor or some internet perv just because you are too lazy to see waht they 're doing .
<en=15>People like this will never have my sympathy , nor do they deserve my sympathy .
<en=16>Look inside yourselves parents , is this you ?
<en=17>Probably it is .
<en=18>Fuck you .
<en=19>Stop trying to pawn your brats off on others to " get a break " .
<en=20>You made a choice to be a mommy , you do nt get a break until they move out , that s the choice that you madea and that 's life .
<en=21>Tough shit .
<en=22>Just because you 're stuck , does nt give you the right to drag down all the singles around you .
<en=23>Another time I 'll segueway into all the fun work related instances where " Mommies " get out of doing work and hiding behind childcare as the reason .
<en=24>This is the insidious conspiracy I call " Mommism " .
<en=25>It must be stamped out .
