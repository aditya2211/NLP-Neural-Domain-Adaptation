<en=1>Winston Peters is visiting a school .
<en=2>In one class , he asks the students if anyone can give him an example of a " tragedy " .
<en=3>One little boy stands up and offers that , " if my best friend who lives next door was playing in the street when a car came along and killed him , that would be a tragedy " .
<en=4>" No , " Winston says , " That would be an ACCIDENT . "
<en=5>A girl raises her hand .
<en=6>" If a school bus carrying fifty children drove off a cliff , killing everyone involved ... that would be a tragedy " .
<en=7>" I 'm afraid not , " explains Winston , " that is what we would call a GREAT LOSS . "
<en=8>The room is silent , none of the other children volunteer .
<en=9>" What ? " asks Winston , " is n't there any one here who can give me an example of a tragedy ? "
<en=10>Finally , a boy in the back raises his hand .
<en=11>In a timid voice , he says : " If an airplane carrying Winston Peters was blown up by a bomb , THAT would be a tragedy " .
<en=12>" Wonderful ! " Winston beams .
<en=13>" Marvelous !
<en=14>And can you tell me WHY that would be a tragedy ? "
<en=15>" Well , " says the boy , " because it would n't be an accident , and it certainly would n't be a great loss ! "
