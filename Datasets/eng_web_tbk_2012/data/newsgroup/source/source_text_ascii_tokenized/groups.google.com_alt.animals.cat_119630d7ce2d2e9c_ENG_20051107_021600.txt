<en=3>Like you said " the kids egg him on " .
<en=4>maybe too much .
<en=5>Sounds like your cat is stressed out .
<en=6>Maybe he does n't want to play when they want to ..
<en=7>He did n't take a dislike to the kids for " no " reason !
<en=8>cats react to the treatment they receive , they are not toys .
<en=9>maybe the cat needs a " new ' home .........
