<en=1>Quebecker wins U.S. bravery award
<en=2>Pittsburgh -
<en=3>A Quebec man was awarded a Carnegie Medal for bravery on Monday for saving two friends by fighting off a polar bear with a pocket knife two years ago on Baffin Island
<en=4>Dr. Eric Fortier , 34 , of Gatineau , Que. , used a pocket knife to attack a polar bear on Baffin Island , just south of the Arctic Circle , to save two friends who were being mauled .
<en=5>" All of the research and all of the preparation I did leading up to the trip gave no indication that there were bears in the Soper [ River ] valley where we were canoeing , " Dr. Fortier said .
<en=6>Dr. Fortier , an orthodontist , learned there was at least one polar bear in the central region of Baffin Island in July 2001 when he felt what he thought was a dog leaning on his tent wall .
<en=7>" My first thought was to push it away , " he said .
<en=8>" A few seconds later my girlfriend saw the shadow of a bear 's paw through the tent fly and then it started ripping through the ceiling . "
<en=9>The polar bear is more dangerous than most other bears .
<en=10>The latter usually consider human beings a threat but the polar bear considers humans a snack , experts said .
<en=11>The two screamed to frighten the bear and warn their friends in a tent several metres away but the bear ripped into that tent and began mauling 31 - year - old Alain Parenteau .
<en=12>" Their screams changed , " Dr. Fortier said .
<en=13>" I grabbed my glasses and my knife and unzipped my tent and headed out . "
<en=14>The bear dwarfed the 6 - foot - 1 Mr. Parenteau , knocking him to the ground , he said .
<en=15>Dr. Fortier threw a large rock at the bear , distracting it and allowing Parenteau to escape but it then turned on 25 - year - old Patricia Doyon , who was in the same tent .
<en=16>Again Dr. Fortier threw rocks at the bear and again its target was able to escape .
<en=17>" The bear gave chase and I gave chase , " he said .
<en=18>" At some point , Patricia tripped or the bear tripped her and was at her back .
<en=19>I was beside the bear 's head and I stabbed it with an upper cut below the jaw in the neck a couple of times . "
<en=20>The bear ran off .
<en=21>While there was some fur and blood on the nine - centimetre blade , Dr. Fortier said he does n't think he hurt the bear badly .
<en=22>Both Mr. Parenteau and Ms. Doyon , however , were bleeding badly .
<en=23>Dr. Fortier and his girlfriend lashed two canoes together and paddled eight kilometres along the Soper River .
<en=24>Dr. Fortier travelled another three kilometres by foot to seek help in the nearest settlement .
<en=25>Both Mr. Parenteau and Ms. Doyon were airlifted to a hospital and survived , though Mr. Parenteau had a gash within a centimetre of his jugular , Dr. Fortier said .
<en=26>Dr. Fortier was one of 15 people to receive the Carnegie Medal on Monday .
<en=27>The bronze medal is given to people who " risk their lives to an extraordinary degree while saving or attempting to save the lives of others . "
<en=28>The other Canadian recipient of the medal was Ronald Joseph Crawford , 42 , of Hamilton , who was killed Aug. 4 , 2002 , while trying to defend a Hamilton sandwich shop owner from a robber wielding a knife .
<en=29>Mr. Crawford threw several punches at the assailant before he was stabbed in the heart .

<en=31>The award comes with a $ 3,500 ( U.S. ) grant .
