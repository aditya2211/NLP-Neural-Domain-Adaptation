<en=24>Revolutionary Compensation
<en=25>Agel has created a new compensation structure that is truly revolutionary .
<en=26>It is our belief that this compensation plan will produce some of the largest checks in network marketing history .
<en=27>The plan ca n't be described as a binary , a breakaway , a unilevel , or a forced matrix .
<en=28>It is a revolutionary hybrid .
<en=29>What is long term viability ?
<en=30>It is not just company longevity .
<en=31>If you used to make $ 100 k and now only make $ 30 k , this is not long term viability .
<en=32>Ten years later your check should still be the same or greater , fulfilling the promise of long - term residual income .
<en=33>The Agel compensation plan includes the principles that ensure that promise can be fulfilled for those who work at it .
