<en=2>Visualizations as a helpful beginning technique
<en=3>-----------------------------------------------
<en=4>If you consider that you still need the assistance of other visualizations to help the mind feel the spirit of transcendence , try the following before moving onto the more formal method below .
<en=5>Visualisations can be as useful tools , but meditation is more than that .
<en=6>Meditation has to do with what is called ideation .
<en=7>It is always good to stick to a formal intense meditation practice like the one for beginners described in the MP3 file that follows after the visualisations .
<en=8>Find a comfortable place on the floor and sit with your legs crossed .
<en=9>Place your hands one on top of the other in your lap , keep your back straight , eyes closed and tongue on the roof of your mouth .
<en=10>Your breathing should be calm and relaxed , through the nose .
<en=11>Spend a minute or so concentrating on your breath , feeling the air flowing through your nostrils .
<en=12>1 . Warm Sun Visualization
<en=13>Continue to breathe slowly and deeply .
<en=14>With each breath , feel the muscles in your body becoming lighter and lighter , and also your external motor and sensory organs are feeling like they are withdrawing from the world into a special inner quietness .
<en=15>Imagine the tension melting away as you continue breathing rhythmically and naturally .
<en=16>Picture yourself sitting on a warm , tropical beach basking in the glow of the sun ... .
<en=17>Visualize the vivid , beautiful colours of the earth ( its flowers and plants ) , the sea next to you , and the sky above you .
<en=18>Feel yourself floating above the earth and sea .
<en=19>As you sit above the world , the warmth of the golden sun penetrates your body and makes you feel warmer and warmer .
<en=20>It surrounds you .
<en=21>The golden rays feel soft and soothing .
<en=22>Now you are far above the earth - into space .
<en=23>Everything around you is so vast .
<en=24>Yet , there is warmth and a familiarity with the vastness .
<en=25>You want to merge your mind with the greater universal Mind that surrounds you .
<en=26>Continue to ideate on this intense desire for your mind to merge with the that universal Consciousness .
<en=27>And while doing so continue using the Baba Nam Kevalam mantra ( breathe in with Baba Nam , breathe out with Kevalam ) .
<en=28>Try this for 5 to 10 minutes .
<en=29>Now come back to earth again - slowly .
<en=30>Imagine yourself sitting on the beach serenely and restfully .
<en=31>Your muscles are loose and limp .
<en=32>Feel your body sinking slightly into the sand making that earthly connection again .
<en=33>The sun 's rays and warmth are still with you , surrounding you .
<en=34>You are in a state of peace and relaxation .
<en=35>With each breath , watch your body and ensure that it remains relaxed - at peace .
<en=36>Continue to feel the warmth of the sunlight all over your body , warming you deeply and gently .
<en=37>You want to bring something back with you from your deep space experience where you sensed your mind merging with the universal Mind .
<en=38>This will be the warmth of the sun - a close reminder and link between earth and the infinite space .
<en=39>Visualize the inside of your body bathed in the golden light , absorbing every ray and glowing as radiantly as the sun .
<en=40>A warm , gentle breeze swirls around your body and relaxes you even more .
<en=41>Let your mind and body be totally at peace .
<en=42>Now feel yourself returning to where you sit ... move your hands and feet a little , stretch them .
<en=43>Open your eyes .
<en=44>2 . Mountain Visualization
<en=45>Another thing you can try .
<en=46>Imagine you 're sitting on top of a mountain , and that it 's the most peaceful place you can think of .
<en=47>Feel that you 're sitting there in complete peace , right on top of the world .
<en=48>Now imagine that infinite happiness is surrounding you in every direction .
<en=49>Feel you 're completely surrounded by that infinite peace and happiness .
<en=50>Now start to repeat within your mind the mantra : BABA NAM KEVALAM .
<en=51>Its meaning is " Infinite happiness is everywhere " .
<en=52>Feel the meaning , do n't just think of its wordy meaning or try to translate from Sanskrit ( BABA NAM KEVALAM ) to an English meaning ( Infinite peace and happiness ) .
<en=53>Think internally , intuitively , not by words , of the meaning , as you 're repeating it .
<en=54>This is called ideation .
<en=55>It is important to take the idea , not just the intellectual analysis .
<en=56>Touching deep into the idea is what builds intuition - it is a synthetic process .
<en=57>Whereas , trying to translate and grapple with wordy meanings is an intellectual mechanism - an analytical process .
<en=58>Feel you 're surrounded by infinite peace and happiness , and feel that your own sense of existence is in direct contact with that endless peace and happiness all around you .
<en=59>You can go further and feel that your unit consciousness , a dot in the Infinite Consciousness , is merging with Infinity .
<en=60>Continue for as long as you like , then open your eyes .
<en=61>OK that is fairly basic :) .
<en=62>The important point is to develop some psycho-spiritual connection between your mind and the universal Consciousness or Supreme Consciousness .
<en=63>Do n't worry if you have trouble concentrating on the mantra and ideation - that 's normal .
<en=64>It takes some time and practice to be able to focus on the one thought .
<en=65>The main thing is to keep practicing .
<en=66>If you do n't practice , then nothing happens .
<en=67>Well maybe a miracle could happen , but let s face it we 're ordinary people and so require practical day to day techniques !
