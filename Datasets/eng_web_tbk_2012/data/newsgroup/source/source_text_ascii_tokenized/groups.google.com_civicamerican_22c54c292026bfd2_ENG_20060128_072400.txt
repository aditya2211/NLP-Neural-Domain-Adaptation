<en=2>The One Reason Why All Americans Should Oppose The Nomination Of Samuel Alito
<en=3>He Would Tear Down Our System Of Checks And Balances , Giving Far Too Much Power To The President
<en=4>My Fellow Americans :
<en=5>As many of you may have heard , President Bush has nominated a long - time Federal Judge named Samuel Alito to become the next member of the United States Supreme Court , to fill a vacancy created by the retirement of another member of the Court .
<en=6>Under our Constitution , this nomination can not take effect unless and until the United States Senate gives its Consent , as described in our Constitution , Article II , Section 2 .
<en=7>A copy of the Constitution , with links back to the official source , is located at http://loveallpeople.org/usconstitutiona.txt
<en=8>Judge Samuel Alito is very highly qualified by all of the normal standards used to evaluate candidates for this position :
<en=9>He has a very high intellect .
<en=10>He graduated very high in his class , from Princeton undergraduate and from Law School at Yale .
<en=11>He has a long and distinguished record , including many years as a Federal Appeals Judge , the next level below Supreme Court .
<en=12>He has encyclopedic knowledge of hundreds of different Supreme Court cases , and he can recite details from memory .
<en=13>He demonstrates an excellent " Judicial Temperament , " being courteous , mild - mannered , respectful of all people ; careful in his work , meticulous in detail .
<en=14>His co-workers love him .
<en=15>His fellow judges love him .
<en=16>His family loves him .
<en=17>President Bush loves him .
<en=18>Yes , it is true that some people do n't like the way they think he will vote on the Supreme Court .
<en=19>But other people do like the way they think he will vote , and the ones who favor him seem to outnumber the ones who oppose him .
<en=20>So now the Senate is getting ready to vote soon , on whether to approve him or not ; and at this moment ( evening of Jan. 27 , 2006 ) it looks like he has more than the fifty - one votes needed for approval .
<en=21>The President is very eager to go ahead quickly and get this vote , because he very much wants to have Samuel Alito on the Supreme Court , to be judging the cases Bush is interested in .
<en=22>So there is a lot of hurry - up pressure on the Senate to give its prompt vote of approval .
<en=23>There is an old saying that applies in this situation : " Act in haste , repent at leisure . "
<en=24>Sometimes you can make a bad decision very quickly , then regret it for many years to come .
<en=25>That is what is about to happen with Judge Samuel Alito , in my opinion , because he has one tragic flaw - a very serious blind spot in his thinking - which makes him completely unacceptable for the position of Supreme Court Justice : He does not really agree with the system of " Checks and Balances " built into the Constitution , and he is ready to start tearing it down in order to follow the " Unitary Executive Theory , " which calls for vastly - increased Presidential Power at the expense of Congress and the Supreme Court .
<en=26>And because of this tragic flaw . . .
<en=27>" He Would Tear Down Our System Of Checks And Balances , Giving Far Too Much Power To The President . "
<en=28>In our Constitutional system , we have three branches of the Federal Government : the Legislative , Executive , and Judicial branches .
<en=29>And the basic idea behind the Checks and Balances we have is that if one branch of the Government goes crazy , the other two can hold it down .
<en=30>But Samuel Alito believes in a little - known Constitutional theory - called the " Unitary Executive Theory " - which says that the President should have complete control over the Executive Branch , and that the Executive Branch should be in charge of almost everything that the Government actually does , including the functions of the Independent Agencies which were designed to be free of Presidential control , and the Military , which exists , which is regulated , and which is funded by specific authority given by the Constitution to Congress , not to the President .
<en=31>The Military is not part of the Executive Branch : it is a separate entity .
<en=32>" Commander In Chief " does n't mean that he is the boss of the Military , merely that he is the Administrator , just as he is the Administrator of the Executive Branch , charged with " executing faithfully " all the laws passed by Congress and all the Decisions rendered by the Supreme Court .
<en=33>Under the Unitary Executive Theory , the Laws of Congress and Decisions of the Supreme Court have no actual authority unless the President agrees with them .
<en=34>And so Congress and the Supreme Court become mere advisors to the President , with no real authority over him .
<en=35>And the President becomes a Dictator , unrestrained by anything in the Constitution , backed up by the Armed Forces , which would be entirely under his personal control .
<en=36>And thus the United States of America - The Land Of The Free And The Home Of The Brave - becomes just another Military Dictatorship , no better than Nazi Germany or Fascist Italy during World War II .
<en=37>AND THAT IS WHY ALL AMERICANS SHOULD OPPOSE THE NOMINATION OF SAMUEL ALITO .
