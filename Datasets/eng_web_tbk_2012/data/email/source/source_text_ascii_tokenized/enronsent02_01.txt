<en=10>The intention of the efforts and actions documented in my earlier update ( see attached email ) was to provide a robust position signoff process for total metal tonnage , spread and brand and location a timely substantiation of stock on balance sheet forward MTM debtors and creditor balances OBSF transactional values and a reconciliation of the barclays intercompany account
<en=11>Despite the best efforts of IT , continuing problems with the AS400 application , a better understanding of the inconsistency between stock reconciliation reports , and concerns over the useability of the outright stock screen enquiry are such that I am currently not confident of delivering sufficient accurate information to AA to satisfy their audit requirements - which at a macro level is the transparent audit trail between stock and forward positions to full accounting values .
<en=12>Consequently I need to inform you of , and / or require your approval for , the following :
<en=13>I will discuss with AA the following
<en=14>that OBSF values within the extended trial balance may be misstated due to data issues ( above and beyond existing conversations with AA on model simplifications )
<en=15>that there are reconciling differences between trader position analyses , AS400 on screen enquiries and the formal global position report ( these differences are at present not understood but would need to be provided to AA within the audit timetable )
<en=16>an outline of the internal balance sheet review process described in my earlier note which must now be reprioritised and rescoped ( see MO work )
<en=17>The creation of an incentive payment pool ( possibly via personal best awards ) for key Metals staff who continue to work exceptionally unsociable hours to meet the above stated objectives
<en=18>The signoff for additional permanent ' Enron ' headcount who will ' duplicate ' certain key position control processes ultimately replacing some existing Traffic staff
<en=19>A reconciling difference of $ 15 mm exists between the reported DPR and the final accounting p&l as generated on the AS400 .
<en=20>We will continue to investigate potential misstatements in the system p&l , as a result of data or system valuation problems , within the month end reporting timeframe .
<en=21>However , this difference may need to be adjusted for following a final review and signoff of system p&l values with traders .
<en=22>The recall of all OBSF stock in early April and retention on balance sheet ( reduced where economically viable ) until positions are fully reconciled and repeatable daily signoff process can be instigated .
<en=23>Middle Office work being prioritised is as follows
<en=24>the stock circularisation initiated for close of business 23rd - with full reconciliation of returns to current system data by traffic / co-ordination an audit of the stock and forward valuation report for the 30th ( replacing planned 23rd review due to system issues ) , requiring full download of contract detail for later reference
<en=25>reconciliation of stock movements between 23rd and 30th sample tests of vanilla forward transactions
<en=26>detailed position analysis of all OBSF contracts that must be reconciled to Barclays documentation
<en=27>spreadsheet recalculation of OBSF option premium utilising the above manually created position analysis
<en=28>the circularisation of Barclays intercompany account and comparison to our cut off and substantiation analysis
<en=29>the debtors / creditors partial circularisation initiated for close of business 23rd
<en=30>I will be in touch directly re the items needing approval
<en=31>Regards

<en=35>Several related issues have resulted in an increase in the level of operating risk for the Merchanting Metals business .
<en=36>Complexities surrounding the operation of the Off Balance Sheet Facility ( " OBSF " ) which commenced two weeks before the year end .
<en=37>The uncertainty generated by the revocation of AA 's signoff for the facility late in the year end audit .
<en=38>The discovery of a number of ' bugs ' within the AS400 Merchanting code , arising from the release of OBSF designed functionality , which compounded the operational burden of supporting the OBSF .
<en=39>The requirement to amend the operational process and OBSF IT code as a result of the current renegotiation of the OBSF with Barclays ( and AA ) .
<en=40>The senior IT developer for Merchanting has resigned and been sent on gardening leave .
<en=41>The Corporate requirement to lower working capital usage for the Merchanting business irrespective of the above parochial business issues .
<en=42>Various mitigating actions have been and will be taken to provide focus , gain comfort over control levels and to provide assurance to senior management as to the accuracy of the Q1 DPR and business balance sheet .
<en=43>The implementation for SAP for the Merchanting business has been delayed and effectively decoupled from the higher risk ( higher benefit ) Brokerage implementation - benefit is to provide sole focus on OBSF for IT Merchanting developers .
<en=44>The AR / AP SAP data quality reviews for both businesses are continuing so as to provide a detailed analysis as at end Q1 .
<en=45>Middle Office have instigated a new daily working capital report process tracking cash settlement / funding data to working capital components for all Metals businesses .
<en=46>An enhanced position signoff process will be implemented prior to end Q1 covering gross tonnage , spread positions and summarised analyses for brand and locations .
<en=47>The necessary report functionality should be available within the AS400 , however contingencies have been initiated to build tactical VBA / excel reports outside of the AS400 but using AS400 data downloads .
<en=48>User requests for additional AS400 functionality and reports have been aggressively prioritised and a code freeze will commence prior to the end of Q1 following the delivery of three reports determined as minimum requirements for the support of OBSF .
<en=49>A resubstantiation of the full Q1 DPR will be completed by the Risk control staff reconciling the full trial balances between Q1 open and Q1 close
<en=50>A full internal balance sheet review will be completed within the Q1 audit timetable which incorporates
<en=51>A full circularisation of inventory balances , and matching to source documentation within Enron
<en=52>Inspection of certain of the above inventory balances , by third party inspectors , where there is an expectation that circularisation replies will not be received on a timely basis
<en=53>Substantive checks back to source contract documentation for the forward priced and unpriced positions report ( spot checking the key position report signed off by the traders )
<en=54>Full reconciliation and recalculation of OBSF option premium values
<en=55>Full reconciliation of contracts within the OBSF to Barclays documentation ( thereby substantiating existence of stock that we have option to purchase ) and to AS400 Barclays account
<en=56>A risk based debtors review - matching to source documentation , where applicable , and any subsequent post quarter end cash movements
<en=57>A full substantiation of creditors to internal ( contract commitments ) or external documentation ( invoices / request for payment )
<en=58>A full reconciliation of intercompany accounts
<en=59>A full substantive reconciliation of cash and funding accounts
<en=60>I intend to provide weekly updates on the status of the above actions during April
<en=61>If you have any questions please call me on x34703
<en=62>Regards
