<en=1>Marianne : The following are my comments :
<en=2>1 . In Section 1.1 , there should be a parentheses after etc. in the 5th line .
<en=3>2 . In Section 3.1 , in the last sentence after the proviso insert " a " before the word " change " and after the word " in " .
<en=4>3 . In Section 6.1 , change 20 Business Days to 20 days .
<en=5>Also , add a semicolon at the end of clause ( i ) .
<en=6>4 . In Section 6.2.1 I 'll just note that the discount rate sentence I think is still an open issue .
<en=7>5 . In Section 6.3 , clause ( c ) should be reworded to fit with the language in the beginning of the Section .
<en=8>6 . Capitalize the word " facility " in the definition of Average Annual Load Factor .
<en=9>7 . Delete the definition of Costs as it is already defined in Section 6.2.1 .
<en=10>8 . Where is the defined term Govt Authority used ?
<en=11>9 . In the GTC , the ECP rep should also apply to EESI .
<en=12>Also , in the 7th line of the reps add the word " into " after the word " entered " and before the word " this " .
<en=13>10 . In Collateral Requests , insert a comma after deposit in the last line .
<en=14>I will also add granting / perfection language .
<en=15>11 . In Events of Default , clause ( a ) refers to a dispute section which I 'm not sure exists .
<en=16>In clause ( e ) , delete the " s " : from the word consolidation .
<en=17>12 . Remedies should be deleted as it is already covered in Section 6.1 .
<en=18>13 . In UCC / Disclaimer of warranties , add a clause ( c ) .
<en=19>I would add setoff language .

<en=23>Carol :
<en=24>I have attempted to incorporate the changes that Jim has incorporated in our long form power agreement which ENA has suggested to date into the short form .
<en=25>Attached please find a sample short form ( for the Con Ed market ) for your review .
<en=26>Please note the following as you review :
<en=27>1 . The short forms do not contain the optionality relating to our performing billing services -- all of our midmarket forms anticipate that we will act as customer 's billing agent and that we will collect all amounts due related to T&D and the like from the customer ( and reflect same on our invoice ) and pass those amounts on to the customer 's utility .
<en=28>2 . I did not include a " Setoff " provision in this draft , mainly because the vast majority of the time , we will not , nor will an affiliate , have another agreement in place with these customers .
<en=29>If you feel strongly about our including a setoff provision , we will do so .
<en=30>3 . The change in law provision reads a bit differently from the long form -- the thinking here is that the long form language is very lengthy and rather harsh ( and we 've had great difficulty selling it in the past ) .
<en=31>Taking into consideration this class of customer , we decided to include certain items , including our inability to cover our costs due to a change in law , rules or practices as a " force majeure event " in an effort to soften the approach ( see the GTCs ) .
<en=32>Also we do not address calculation of a termination payment in the event of a change in law as the long form does -- again , more in the interest of " saving space " than anything else ...
<en=33>Let us know your thoughts on this document and if you are comfortable with our using this until such time as the hybrid form is launched .
<en=34>If you are comfortable , we will drive these changes into our other midmarket power forms .
<en=35>Thanks again for your help with this project ,
<en=36>Marianne
<en=37>P.S. Please be sure to copy Sarah Dietrich and Jennifer Hillegonds on your response -- they will be taking this project during my " hiatus " -- I am moving to PA on Friday of this week , and will be out of pocket through approximately 7/16 .
<en=38>I will start up again in mid-July ...
<en=39>John :
<en=40>I have faxed to you the form of Bond , our proposed Bond provisions and the EEI Master .
<en=41>I am waiting on the confirms and will send them to you shortly by fax or e-mail .

<en=46>Phyllis :
<en=47>Our letter of credit person would be more comfortable if we deleted all of the language that makes the LC transferable .
<en=48>Are you okay with that ?
<en=49>If so , are we ready to execute ?

<en=54>I understand that we are still reviewing the attachment that lists the open transactions .
<en=55>How are you making out on the revised version of the LOC ?
<en=56>Marianne :
<en=57>In addition to my other comments on the Mid Market Power Form , I think you should add a forward contract rep .

<en=65>His number is 860-665-2368 and e-mail address is leporjj@selectenergy.com .

<en=77>Do you want 6/1/01 and forward or do you want to include all of May since they have not been settled ?
<en=78>Just let me know and I can send you a new attachment .
<en=79>Carol St Clair 05/25/2001 10:56 AM

<en=81>Does Attachment A to the Select EEI Master need to be updated or is the version that you sent to me the current version ?

<en=85>Carol -
<en=86>I think Valerie Mooney ( our credit person ) and Ed Sacks are still discussing some minor fine tuning of the LOC format .
<en=87>I spoke to Bob Bruce this morning - we 're all set on the language in the Schedule to the ISDA , and there is a minor credit / billing issue in Paragraph 13 related to the timing of transfer of interest on collateral that Val will discuss with Ed as well .
<en=88>As far as the EEI goes , the only remaining issue that I 'm aware of ( aside from finalizing the LOC ) is whether we 've finished coordinating the Attachment containing the list of prior transactions .
<en=89>Sounds like we may actually get these documents executed early next week .

<en=120>Carol -
<en=121>Our credit person does n't understand why the transferability language needs to be eliminated .
<en=122>It simply refers to the same ICC publication for the transfer process that governs the letter of credit generally .
<en=123>Is there some specific concern that we can address ?
<en=124>Russell :
<en=125>Your comments to the transfer agreement were fine .
<en=126>With respect to the Guaranty , I will delete the Schedule .
<en=127>Our system did not show any other chnages .
<en=128>Were there any ?
<en=129>Carol
<en=130>Yes .
