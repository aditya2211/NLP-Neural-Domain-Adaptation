<en=3>I spoke to Bruce Garcey at NiMo regarding their RFP .
<en=4>Bruce indicated NiMo short listed five companies who all bid higher than ENA .
<en=5>However , he also mentioned we were a close sixth , that is close to the fifth highest bid .
<en=6>He gave no indication on the value of the highest bid .
<en=7>He also said that the other five companies making the short list all proposed alternative structures to the proposed NiMo Tier Structure .
<en=8>NiMo released an additional RFP for peaking supplies for this winter , I believe Phil should have or be getting that RFP .
<en=9>Phil if you could please make copies and distribute ASAP .
<en=10>Thanks ,
<en=11>Sean
<en=12>Here you go .
<en=13>If you have any other questions , please let me know .
