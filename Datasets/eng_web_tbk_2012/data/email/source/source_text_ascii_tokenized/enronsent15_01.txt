<en=1>It was good to hear from you !
<en=2>We had a nice Thanksgiving here too .
<en=3>It 's funny , because usually it 's just me , Mom , Craig and Danelia , and Danelia does n't really like roasted turkey or roast beef ( not that she would say it to me ! ) , so there is not just the same joy in cooking it would be elsewise .
<en=4>It was good having the girls down .
<en=5>We played a new version of Uno called " African Uno " that was complex , fast and at times , physically challenging .
<en=6>It 's not for the meek .
<en=7>It was incredible what a good player Alena was .
<en=8>She had her cards memorized as well as everyone else s ( when you play you 'll see why you can know everyone else s hands ! ) .
<en=9>I expect Craig did n't want Mom to see his place because it was messy .
<en=10>I think compared to my house , he 's embarrased about his apartment .
<en=11>Then , also , he 's got so much stuff in there right now , that I do n't know how he 's going to fit baby stuff .
<en=12>They would only give him a 6 month lease when he renewed his lease last month because they do n't want 3 people in that small apartment .
<en=13>So he 's going to have to start looking for another place .
<en=14>And his apartment is so run down down I 'm afraid roaches might be crawling over the baby .
<en=15>I guess Mom is going to come back down sometime in March or April to see the new baby .
<en=16>You 'll have to come visit to check out my new house .
<en=17>The upstairs " guest suite " is pretty neat .
<en=18>It 's got its own bathroom and tv , and is pretty cozy .
<en=19>As far as the call with Uncle Ben goes , if he was thrilled to hear from me I could n't tell by his voice .
<en=20>It was a pretty stilted conversation for both of us .
<en=21>But , I guess , it 's a start ...
<en=22>I 've already made my XMAS plans .
<en=23>I leave the evening of the 21st , my flight comes in about 10 pm , and leave the morning of the 27th at 6 am .
<en=24>It 's good chatting with you .
<en=25>Keep in touch !

<en=62>Regards ,

<en=64>Attached is the referenced agreement .
<en=65>Let me know if the notice information is OK with you .
<en=66>If so , I 'll get it signed by Craig Breslau today , then bring it to you for countersignature .
<en=67>Thinking about that , what 's your title ?
<en=68>I 'm not sure you have the authority to sign documents w/o special authority ...
<en=69>No , it does not mean that .
<en=70>Adding all the Enron " Specified Entities " would only make a default under a financial transaction with those other Enron entities a default under this agreement .
<en=71>Our concern is that we do n't want any trading related defaults to ever trigger a default under a loan transaction which has a swap as a component .
<en=72>Richard Sage
<en=73>11/30/2000 10:52 AM
<en=74>If you do add all the entities , does that mean that we would not need to put in place a separate agreement for ECCL ?
<en=75>With respect to Deutsche Bank ( "" DB " ) , we have one credit issue remaining , DB would like us to add all the Enron trading entities DB trades with as Specified Entities under the ISDA Master Agreement and we are somewhat hesitant to do so , as this could potentially roll up swaps under structured loan transactions into a default under the ISDA Agreement .
<en=76>Sara and Bill Bradford in Credit are supposed to talk to the DB Credit people about this remaining issue .
<en=77>With respect to First Union National Bank , the draft we were working from was so old that they agreed to look at our current form of agreement which was sent to them on 11/8/00 for review .
<en=78>Sara is working on that with Susan Bailey , another paralegal in our Group .

<en=81>Tana -
<en=82>can you please give me an update on where you are in the negotiations of the ISDA with the following counterparties and confirm which Enron entity you are negotiating on behalf of .
<en=83>Tks ,
<en=84>Denis
<en=85>First Union National Bank
<en=86>Deutsched Bank AG
<en=87>I spoke to Mark Taylor about your signing authority , and he agrees that you do not have the authority to execute documents on your own , but as long as you are only co-signing documents signed by an authorized officer as a control measure we 're OK .
