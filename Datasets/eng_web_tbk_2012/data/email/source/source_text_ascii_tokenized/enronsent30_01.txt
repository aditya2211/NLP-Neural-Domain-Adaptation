<en=17>John
<en=18>Not yet .
<en=19>Did you happen to sign your employment agreement ?
<en=20>Please respond to request below .
<en=21>Thanks .
<en=22>John Lavorato has requested the attached report .
<en=23>He is concerned about the allocation amongst categories - in particular , Real Time Traders .
<en=24>If you would , please review the entire list and let me know if you are in agreement with the presentation by tomorrow evening , if possible .
<en=25>I 'm at x if you have any questions .
<en=26>Thanks !
<en=27>I understand all of those comparisons , however , the reality is if we lose Dean ( which we will if we do n't pay 65 k + 10 k ) , we will end up hiring a replacement at 75 - 80 k .
<en=28>This is pretty easy math for me .
<en=29>I know it seems like a stretch , but the market for hourly traders is very strong right now .
<en=30>I would like to get this done ASAP .
<en=31>Thanks .
<en=32>I am reviewing the request for an employment agreement renewal on Mark Dean Laurent .
<en=33>Juan communicated some numbers to me and when reviewing this request would like to ask you to consider the following :
<en=34>Current Salary : $ 47,500
<en=35>Job Group : Specialist
<en=36>YE PRC Rating : Satisfactory
<en=37>Original Proposition :
<en=38>Base Salary 65 k
<en=39>1 Year Agreement
<en=40>$ 5,000 signing
<en=41>Revised Proposal :
<en=42>Base Salary : 55 k
<en=43>1 Year agreement
<en=44>$ 5,000 signing
<en=45>Business Case : If we offered Dean 55 k or 60 k it would still constitute a over a $ 10,000 increase ( approximately 25 % ) and taking into consideration he was rated as satisfactory at the specialist level .
<en=46>Also , the top of the salary range for a specialist is 66 k .
<en=47>It would still give him room to progress in the current job group should he not be promoted .
<en=48>Secondly , he will still out price performers that you have in the same job group that are excellent and strong performers respectively eg. Paul Thomas , Jason Choate , Todd DeCook and Peter Makkai .
<en=49>Salary Listing in Job Group :
<en=50>Maria Valdes superior $ 62,500
<en=51>Paul Thomas excellent $ 55,008
<en=52>Jason Choate excellent $ 60,008
<en=53>Todd DeCook strong $ 42,008
<en=54>Peter Makkai strong $ 47,500
<en=55>Let me know your thoughts .... then I will run it by Oxley .
<en=56>Are we going to attend ?
