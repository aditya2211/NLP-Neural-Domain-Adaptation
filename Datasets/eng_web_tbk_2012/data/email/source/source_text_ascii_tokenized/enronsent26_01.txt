<en=9>This Friday - Michael goes for a visit at St. Francis , which may be his new school ( so far , so good ) .
<en=10>I 'll be in around 1000
<en=11>Most Fridays I 'm going to TRY to pick Michael up since I 'm away so much , which means leaving by 445 or so .
<en=12>October 4 , ENA orientation in the am .
<en=13>October 19 / 20 , Neil is out of town , so I have to pick Michael up from school ( leave at 430 )
<en=14>October 26 / 27 , hope to be vacation time .
<en=15>Neil has a meeting in San Antonio ( usually it is in Miami , San Francisco , Phoenix - not so great this year ) .
<en=16>It is the officer 's meeting for Enterprise , and spouses are invited .
<en=17>This means we wo n't be in town for the Compaq thing .
<en=18>Figures , of course .
<en=19>Thanks for asking .
<en=20>I 'm watching for some good vacation days , also ...

<en=22>I have a couple of questions so I can wrap up the LOI :
<en=23>We refer to licensed Fuel Cell Energy equipment .
<en=24>Do we intend to reference a particular manufacturer , or should this be more generic ?
<en=25>Do we want to attach a draft of the Development Agreement , and condition the final deal on agreeing to terms substantially the same as what 's in the draft ?
<en=26>I have a concern that the Enron optionality bug could bite us on the backside with that one .
<en=27>Do we expect to have ONE EPC contract , or several ?
<en=28>I 'm looking for the confidentiality agreement , which may be in Bart 's files ( have n't checked closely yet ) .
<en=29>If anyone has it handy , it could speed things up for me .
<en=30>Thanks ,
<en=31>Kay
<en=32>Forget the ONE or more contract questions .
<en=33>I see we expect to have separate contracts for each project .

<en=44>On the issue of the contracts , the draft says that the $ 170 m is paid when the EPC contract is signed .
<en=45>Are we expecting that the portion attributable to each project will be paid as the individual EPC contracts are signed ?
<en=46>Thanks ,
<en=47>Kay
<en=48>1 . The pricing that we have given CRRA is specific to FuelCell Energy and would not be meaningful without listing the manufacturer ( i.e. , ONSI would be a lot more money ) .
<en=49>Hence , I think that we have to reference the manufacturer .
<en=50>2 . The attachment of the Development Agreement is a Jeff question .
<en=51>In order to mark any 2000 income , we will need to get CRRA to execute the Development Agreement in 2000 .
<en=52>In my opinion , we should show CRRA a copy of the LOI with the assumption that the Development Agreement is attached .
<en=53>I would actually send them the draft Development Agreement a couple days after the LOI .
<en=54>Based on how CRRA reacts , I would make an ultimate determination if the agreement needs to be attached to the LOI .
<en=55>3 . I expect at least one EPC contract per project .
<en=56>We do n't want to condition the acceptance of one project on the performance of another project .
<en=57>Performance tests will either be performed on a project basis or a unit by unit basis in a given project .
<en=58>Remarkably clear explanation .
