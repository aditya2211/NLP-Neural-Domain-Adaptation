<en=4>it is to late for me to add changes .
<en=5>We will have to correct them after the churn .
<en=6>Thank you for you patience .
<en=7>The Dow topped out in February of 1966 at 995 .
<en=8>By September of that year the Dow had tumbled to 744 .
<en=9>The Dow then rallied to a high of 943 in September of '67 .
<en=10>By March of '68 the Dow had fallen to 825 , only to climb to a highly speculative peak of 985 in December of '68 .
<en=11>The Dow then sank to 631 in December of '70 .
<en=12>By April of '71 the Dow had climbed back to 950 , only to fall to 869 in February of '72 .
<en=13>A big rally then took the Dow ( unconfirmed ) to a record high of 1051 in January of '73 , turning everyone bullish .
<en=14>But by December of '73 the Dow had collapsed to 788 .
<en=15>Think that was bad - by December of '74 the Dow had sunk to a bear market low of 577 .
<en=16>At that time , the gurus and geniuses of Wall Street were predicting a 250 Dow and many were talking openly about the end of capitalism .
<en=17>Of course , that was the bottom
<en=18>And that 's the way the greatest bear market since the Depression worked its way down .
<en=19>By late 1974 investors were dizzy , they were desperate , they were wrung - out , they had left Wall Street , many for good .
<en=20>great , we look forward to seeing you .

<en=32>The results of the February 26th PVT test conducted on Nville have been discussed with each of you over the last three months .
<en=33>As we have discussed .... effective Sep 13th , Anita will make the adjustments to Enron 's inventory and pad gas to reflect the February 26th results .
<en=34>I talked with Gary Wilson , and he confirmed that the revised values are correct .
<en=35>Attached is a spreadsheet that contains the values .
<en=36>The correction to the working gas includes TWO corrections .
<en=37>The results of the February 26th test reduces the working gas by 398,487 MMBTU .
<en=38>In addition , there is a reduction of 22,101 MMBTU which is the difference between the SCADA values ( Best Available ) that Anita showed on the February 29th Storage Sheet and the " official " February 29th values that Gary Wilson received from MIPS .
<en=39>To summarize : Enron 's pad gas will now be 3,993,310 MMBTU , instead of 4,223,000 MMBTU .
<en=40>Enron 's working gas will be reduced by 420,588 MMBTU .
<en=41>Call me if there are any questions .
<en=42>fyi
