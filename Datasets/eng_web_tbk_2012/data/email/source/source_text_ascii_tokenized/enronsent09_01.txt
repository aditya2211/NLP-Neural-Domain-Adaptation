<en=24>Essie ,

<en=26>If possible , can you also give an indication of the rank - 1 through 5 ?
<en=27>Thanks ,

<en=29>I have a few entities that may need to change groups or be assigned to a group .
<en=30>18T - EI Indonesia Operations LLC
<en=31>This entity is not in TIS , SAP , nor Hyperion .
<en=32>The 2000 tax return has no income , assets , or liabilities .
<en=33>There is a corporate data sheet for this company , but this entity seems to have been inactive since it 's creation .
<en=34>86M - Enron Net Works LLC
<en=35>Despite the name , this entity appears to be a MTM company .
<en=36>Per September financials , this company has about $ 3 M of MTM and about $ 8 K of expenses , nothing else .
<en=37>The next 5 companies were my responsibility while in EBS , and did not get assigned during the reorg .
<en=38>80Y - Enron Broadband Acquisition , Inc .
<en=39>This entity was created in 2000 for the acquistion of WarpSpeed Communications ( now Enron WarpSpeed Services , Inc. 83N ) , and then dissolved upon completion of merger .
<en=40>Company is around with a small amount of assets and liabilities , but no I/S items .
<en=41>83N is my responsibility .
<en=42>I think this entity should stay with 83N .
<en=43>So I suggest it be assigned to Leon .
<en=44>It should be 4 - easy .
<en=45>1579 - EBS Network Co. Division of 17H .
<en=46>This one should possibly be assigned to Networks & Services group .
<en=47>Not currently on our list of companies .
<en=48>I think this could go to either Holding / Administrative Companies ( Same as 17H ) or Network & Services ( Leon ) .
<en=49>4 - easy .
<en=50>1691 - EPI - EBS Europe
<en=51>Set up last month to centralize merchant asset activities .
<en=52>Broke out the activities of 1179 .
<en=53>A similar entity ( 1179 ) was assigned to Commodity and Trade ( Todd Richards and Mary Fischer ) so this one should be assigned to them as well .
<en=54>4 - easy .
<en=55>1307 - EBIC - Apache , LLC
<en=56>Rolls up to Cherokee Finance VOF , a CFC .
<en=57>Cherokee Finance VOF is assigned to North America ( Glen Walloch and Kevin Walker ) .
<en=58>Maybe this one should also go to them as the only tax which may have to be provided would be foreign tax .
<en=59>4 - easy .
<en=60>1689 - EPI - EBS Ventures , LLC
<en=61>Set up last month to centralize merchant asset activities .
<en=62>Broke out the activities of 1307 .
<en=63>Same as 1307 .
<en=64>It should be assigned to North America ( Glen Walloch and Kevin Walker ) .
<en=65>4 - easy .
<en=66>Let me know if you have any questions .

<en=68>No problem about moving Company 1691 over
<en=69>I see that it is a 4 , so that will be no problem .
<en=70>How do you feel about taking on another company ?
<en=71>Essie and Leon have proposed xferring Co. 1691 to your world ( see below ) .
