<en=8>Phillip ,
<en=9>This section pertains to terminated employees who are paid out in the year following the termination event .
<en=10>The way the tax law works , the tax basis for your share distribution will be based on the closing stock price the day preceding notification to the transfer agent .
<en=11>As such , we will distribute net shares calculating the proper withholding at fair market value the day prior to notifying the transfer agent .
<en=12>We will be distributing the shares reflected on your 9/30/01 statement ( 6,606 shares plus cash for fractional shares ) .
<en=13>If you would prefer to settle the taxes with a personal check , we can distribute gross shares .
<en=14>Please let me know you preference .
<en=15>As you know , we are in the process of transferring recordkeeping services from NTRC to Hewitt .
<en=16>As such , we have a CPA , Larry Lewis , working with us to audit and set up transition files .
<en=17>He has become our department expert on the PSA account ( much more knowledgeable than myself ) and the various plan provision amendments .
<en=18>If you would like , we can set up a conference call with you , myself , and Larry to go over the payment methodology .
<en=19>Please let me know a date and time that is convenient for you .
<en=20>Thanks ,
<en=21>Renee
<en=22>Renee ,
<en=23>Thank you for digging in to the issue of Deferred Phantom Stock Units .
<en=24>It is clear that the payment will be made in shares .
<en=25>However , I still do n't understand which date will be used to determine the value and calculate how many shares .
<en=26>The plan document under VII .
<en=27>Amount of Benefit Payments reads " The value of the shares , and resulting payment amount will be based on the closing price of Enron Corp. common stock on the January 1 before the date of payment , and such payment shall be made in shares of Enron Corp. common stock . "
<en=28>Can you help me interpret this statement and work through the numbers on my account .
<en=29>Thank you ,
<en=30>Phillip Allen
<en=31>Let me know when you get the quotes from Pauline .
<en=32>I am expecting to pay something in the $ 3, to $ 5,000 range .
<en=33>I would like to see the quotes and a description of the work to be done .
<en=34>It is my understanding that some rock will be removed and replaced with siding .
<en=35>If they are getting quotes to put up new rock then we will need to clarify .
<en=36>Jacques is ready to drop in a dollar amount on the release .
<en=37>If the negotiations stall , it seems like I need to go ahead and cut off the utilities .
<en=38>Hopefully things will go smoothly .

<en=46>Greg ,
<en=47>I faxed you the promotional on 10300 Heritage Office Building with the Nimitz post office .
<en=48>The broker called back shortly after I spoke to you to let me know that the kestrel air park building and the strip center at fm78 & walzem had both sold .
<en=49>Let me know what you think of this property .
<en=50>Also , let me know of any other ideas about replacement property .
<en=51>Phillip
<en=52>Jim ,
<en=53>Take a look at this spreadsheet .
<en=54>I tried to calculate the IRR on the port Aransas and Roma post offices .
<en=55>Is this how your clients usually evaluate these properties ?
<en=56>The Roma deal looks much better .
<en=57>Phillip
<en=58>Mery ,
<en=59>This sounds better than the limitations you were describing in the meeting .
<en=60>We should be able to work with this .
