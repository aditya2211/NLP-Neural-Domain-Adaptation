<en=18>Now , Debbie wants it .
<en=19>I gave $ 16,900 + tax .
<en=20>It is very clean and is Sandalwood , Driftwood or something of that nature in color .
<en=21>Almost silver .
<en=22>I have to pick up old gray over at Jerry 's .
<en=23>Debbie said , it is going to be hard on me to sale my old dodge truck .
<en=24>I said Yep , had that truck longer than I have had most of my women .
<en=25>I really need to engage brain before articulating !
<en=26>I am doing dirt work and hope to plant ST Augustine Grass by Friday before rain .
<en=27>One thing is for sure , the economy is not faltering on my account .
<en=28>Dow Stock is back up over $ 33 .
<en=29>Hooray , hoorah !
<en=30>Needs to go to $ 41 and then I will be happy .
<en=31>I spoke with Gerald and he said there are a bunch of folks hanging around Dad 's place .
<en=32>We need to change the lock and place posted signs at the gate .
<en=33>I may want to put some steers or heifers up there .
<en=34>I am going up soon and having the tractor fixed .
<en=35>Reggie said he will pay us soon .
<en=36>He also still wants the tractor if we can hold on to it .
<en=37>First come , first serve .
<en=38>When is the wedding ?

<en=40>Be sure to take your sweety out on the balcony tonight and gaze at the full moon .
<en=41>It was sure beautiful coming up last night .
<en=42>We used to go out and lay in the pasture on a blanket and watch for the space shuttle .
<en=43>I had a couple of hickies on my neck the day after and the guys all wanted to know if those were shuttle burns .
<en=44>Just jealous .
<en=45>My kid is making wonderful grades and has reassured me she will graduate within the four year period .

<en=56>You should have listened to Maw , as long as you keep your mouth shut and your pants zipped , you will be alright .
<en=57>Shucks , guess none of us three paid much attention to that .
<en=58>Oh , Jeff Sherrar has a new book out .

<en=86>Would you please ck the Oglethorpe deal from July 2000 - Dec 2000 ?
<en=87>Is there supposed to be a cashout booked in Sitara for these months ?
