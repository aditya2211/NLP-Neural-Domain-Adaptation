<en=1>All ,
<en=2>Please see the attached Interconnect Agreement with Questar .
<en=3>I wanted you all to have a look at what we believe is the final draft .
<en=4>It is a fairly standard , fully reimbursable interconnect with Questar .
<en=5>Transwestern will own and operate the interconnect .
<en=6>You will notice that Questar has requested a " Payment Plan " that details when they will pay Transwestern for the interconnect due to the recent Enron events .
<en=7>If anyone has any questions or concerns about the timing of these payments , please give me a call .
<en=8>Also , you will notice this interconnect may not be subject to the CIAC tax gross up , but to protect ourselves , we have added language in Para 3.2 that protects us financially if the IRS ever comes back to determine that this interconnect is subject to the CIAC tax .
<en=9>Robert Guthrie with the tax department has worked with us to develop this language .
<en=10>We hope to execute this Agreement this week .
<en=11>If you have any comments , please let me know .
<en=12>After execution , we will forward a final copy to you for your files .
<en=13>Thanks ,

<en=16>Earl ,
<en=17>We are looking at putting the metering facilities on their ROW ( also , I think we will have to purchase about 50 ft of ROW from ElPaso to get to Questar 's property ) .
<en=18>As you look at this , if for some reason we can not obtain ElPaso ROW , we will have to look at Plan B which would be to put the metering on our ROW .
<en=19>Our in - service date is May 1 .
<en=20>If you think that May 1 may be difficult due to receiving the parts / materials on a timely basis because of the issues that vendors may have with us because of recent Enron events , please let me know .
<en=21>Questar has already informed us that they would help obtain parts / materials to our specifications if it helps achieve an in - service date of May 1 .
<en=22>Thanks , Kim .
<en=23>Kim
<en=24>Has a location , Theirs or TW land / ROW , been settled and when is the required in - service date ?
<en=25>Thanks

<en=51>John , sorry for the late response , but I think you can implement immediately .
<en=52>I was in a meeting last week and this was discussed ( I do n't remember if you were there or not ) but I 'm thinking that you may have already proceeded ahead for implementation which is great , thanks !
<en=53>Kim .
<en=54>The telephony group has the new TW Hotline number and extensions ready for use , I have the solution center entering the greetings and Terry Kowalke has a new form and procedure for the Customer Service Reps. to use for updates .
<en=55>How much notification would you like to give the TW customers before implementing the new TW Hotline phone number ?
<en=56>We can do a Popup notification along with changing the number on the Web page , we can also put out a Critical message which will send an Email to customers .
<en=57>Do you think we need to do more ?
<en=58>Thanks : John Buchanan
<en=59>Yes , thanks .
<en=60>I was aware .
<en=61>I just could n't remember if it was you or Terry .
<en=62>Thanks , Kim .
<en=63>Kim ,
<en=64>The new TW Hotline was implemented Monday which included customer notification in the form of a Popup message in TMS and a Critical Notice which sent an Email .
<en=65>The new Hotline phone number is 713-853-3044 .
<en=66>I was under the impression that Terry Kowalke had notified you of the implementation , TK was also made aware .

<en=76>Here it is .
<en=77>K .
<en=78>See the attached spreadsheet .
<en=79>Let me know if you have any questions .
<en=80>Jan ,
<en=81>These numbers are slightly different from the ones you put together a few weeks ago .
<en=82>Are you comfortable with the difference ?
<en=83>Any thoughts ?
<en=84>No hurry , I was just wondering .
<en=85>Thanks ,

<en=87>Attached is the TW Top Ten Shippers by Revenues for the year 2001 to be reported in the Browncover report .
<en=88>Note :
<en=89>Total transportation invoiced for 2001 was $ 180.9 m .
<en=90>The amount of transportation revenues recorded in the general ledger is $ 165.9 m .
<en=91>This difference is mainly due to the following :
<en=92>$ 10.0 m - negotiated rates reserve ( Reliant , Sempra , Richardson , Astr , and BP Energy ) - $ collected
<en=93>$ 2.7 m - SoCal rate issue - $ not collected
<en=94>$ 1.8 m - additional month of PGE revenues due to prepayment invoicing beginning in 2001 - $ collected
<en=95>Revenues for these customers were adjusted according .
<en=96>Also , revenues for the shippers acquiring released volumes from PGE at rates above TW 's tariff rates were adjusted accordingly .
<en=97>Please call me at x36709 if there are questions
<en=98>thanks ,

<en=112>See you Sunday .

<en=115>Mansoor ,
<en=116>Let 's discuss .
<en=117>Kim .
<en=118>Kim
<en=119>The in - service date of May 1 , will be very difficult to attain .
<en=120>Since the bankruptcy filing , vendors have been very reluctant to ship material prior to it being prepaid ( Daniels , Fisher , Rosemont , other ) .
<en=121>These are the vendors of instrumentation required for the interconnect .
<en=122>Questar may be able to purchase material , but some of the items can have up to a 60 day delivery .
<en=123>( From time PA approved and funded to in - service will be 75 days at most .
<en=124>We have worked with Daniels on a chromatograph on another project and prepayment has taken 45 days alone .
<en=125>Daniels is not set up for prepayments as they bill off an invoice and the main office and accounting had to create an invoice for a chromatograph that had not been delivered .
<en=126>Not the usual mode of operations .
<en=127>The I/C design is for a UltraSonic meter and this is dependent on their testing schedule ( Canada or Kansas are the only two places to test to 100 % of design ) .
<en=128>Will confirm testing schedule and delivery dates with UltraSonic ASAP .
<en=129>We will try to complete the I/C with the earliest in - service date possible , but with conditions as they are , a realistic date would be June 15 , 2002 .
<en=130>If you have questions or issues , please let me know .
<en=131>Thanks
