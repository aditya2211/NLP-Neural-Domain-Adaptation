<en=4>The eThink Team
<en=5>We recently asked you to create an eSpeak " wish list " for us .
<en=6>The response was tremendous and , in some cases , very creative .
<en=7>Your fellow employees asked for everyone from Britney Spears to George Bush .
<en=8>In all , we received requests for 61 persons outside of Enron to host an eSpeak event .
<en=9>We thought you might like to know who your colleagues find interesting , so we 've provided a sampling of the suggestions below .
<en=10>Here are the top ten most requested eSpeakers .
<en=11>10 . Jack Welch , CEO , General Motors
<en=12>9 . Scott McNeally , CEO , Sun Microsystems
<en=13>8 . Satisfied Enron Customers
<en=14>7 . Stephen Covey , author , The Seven Habits of Highly Effective People
<en=15>6 . Oprah Winfrey , talkshow host
<en=16>5 . General Colin Powell , former Chairman , Joint Chiefs of Staff , U.S.A .
<en=17>4 . Alan Greenspan , Chairman , Federal Reserve , U.S.A .
<en=18>3 . Former U.S. President George Bush
<en=19>2 . Bill Gates , CEO , Microsoft
<en=20>1 . Texas Governor George W. Bush
<en=21>While we ca n't make any promises , we will do our best to bring in at least some of these special guests .
<en=22>If you have any contacts who could help us get in touch with these guest speakers , please let us know at ethink@enron.com .
<en=23>Everybody needs a little help now and then , even eSpeak .
<en=24>There were plenty of internal speakers requested , as well .
<en=25>Those requests should be somewhat easier to meet , although scheduling time with some of our colleagues can be quite a task !
<en=26>Thank you all for your participation .
<en=27>Dale ,
<en=28>Confirmed .

<en=42>That would be particularly convenient for me .
<en=43>I will have to leave downtown at about 945 to catch a plane .
<en=44>That will ensure that I wo nt take up too much of your time !!

<en=73>I would like the pre-meeting site cruise .
<en=74>How can we arrange it ?
<en=75>Vince
<en=76>Please respond to < ekrapels@esaibos.com >
<en=77>Vince ,
<en=78>We 're all set for 2:30 on July 12 .
<en=79>How about a pre-meeting web site cruise on Friday , July 7 at 11 AM EDT ?
<en=80>Ed
<en=81>Ed ,
<en=82>Wednesday , July 12 , 2:300 will work for me .
<en=83>I shall be glad to review your website -- www.weathereffects.com .
<en=84>I shall invite some people who work on electricity in my group to join me .
<en=85>Vince
<en=86>Please respond to < ekrapels@esaibos.com >
<en=87>Vince ,
<en=88>Good to hear from you and I 'm glad you 're available .
<en=89>How is Wednesday at 2:30 ?
<en=90>I did look at EOL and am not surprised to see its quality .
<en=91>I was unable to say much about it in my Risk Electricity Hedging and Trading report because of deadline pressures .
<en=92>How is the site doing ?
<en=93>I am intrigued by the competition for trading platforms and was astonished to hear that Goldman , Morgan , BP and Shell were going to launch a site to compete with yours .
<en=94>Talk about a shotgun marriage !
<en=95>If we have time next week , I could step you through our website -- www.weathereffects.com .
<en=96>I 'm very proud of what we 've done .
<en=97>I ca n't give out a password yet but would be happy to walk through the site with you over the phone using my password .
<en=98>It 's a very ambitious site -- with state - of - the - art WSI weather ( seasonal , 6 - 10 , and day to day ) driving a good load model for PJM and NEPOOL .
<en=99>ESAI contributes oil and gas input price forecasts , capacity judgments , and " herding " ideas to develop power price forecasts for same time periods .
<en=100>After one month 's full - bore effort , I 'm pleased with the results ( e.g. , we forecast Nepool onpeak to be $ 43 and it turned out $ 46 ) .
<en=101>Have a great weekend .
<en=102>Ed
<en=103>Ed ,
<en=104>I shall be available on both days .
<en=105>What about Wednesday , July 12 , between 1:30 and 4:00 .
<en=106>Please , let me know what time would work for you .
<en=107>It will be nice to see you again .
<en=108>Vince
<en=109>P.S. By the way , did you have a chance to take a look at the EOL ?
<en=110>Please respond to ekrapels@esaibos.com
