<en=1>Vince ,
<en=2>We are still trying to work the PSE swap transaction , now that the forex desk has been able to find a fix for CPI in the market .
<en=3>Further to my voicemail , our colleagues in credit are calculating the reserve on the PSE swap .
<en=4>They are currently using 9.5 % fixed based on the 1 year implied volatility .
<en=5>Volatility of USD / DM has been in the range of between 7 % and 11 % .
<en=6>Can one of your research staff justify a suitable 20 year volalatility number for USD / Euro .
<en=7>Ideally , we would like a fast turnaround .
<en=8>In addition , is there someone who could consider the correlation between US CPI and the $ / euro exchange rate .
<en=9>The credit guys are currently assuming that there is no correlation and may consequently be double dipping the credit reserve on this basis too .
<en=10>Grateful for any help or suggestions you could provide .

<en=12>Vincent ,
<en=13>I met you at the Risk conference last week in Houston .
<en=14>I enjoyed your presentations very much .
<en=15>I was wondering if you could give me some references regarding the calculation of correlation coefficients from a GARCH model .
<en=16>Thank you .
