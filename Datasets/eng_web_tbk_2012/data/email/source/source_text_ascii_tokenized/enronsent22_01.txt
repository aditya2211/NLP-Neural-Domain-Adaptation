<en=1>Hello Janice :
<en=2>I enjoyed your recent e-mail but was sorry to hear about your dad .
<en=3>It sounds as though his health has deteriorated significantly .
<en=4>These are always difficult times .
<en=5>As I watched my mother and father 's health deteriorate and ultimately watched them die , it is a very defining time in our lives .
<en=6>But we can be very thankful to have such great parents and to have had the privilege to have been raised in such loving homes .
<en=7>Sounds as though Eric has done very well as SMSU .
<en=8>He is joining an excellent company .
<en=9>I am also delighted to hear that he will continue his education working toward an MBA .
<en=10>As we are living in an age where intellectual capital is so valuable , it is important for every young person to obtain the very best possible education they can .
<en=11>As to our family , within the last ten days our youngest daughter Elizabeth was married to a young man from Buenos Aires , Argentina .
<en=12>They met while they were both working on a project as lawyers in Buenos Aires .
<en=13>They 're currently on their honeymoon but shortly after returning will be moving from Buenos Aires to Miami , Florida .
<en=14>This past Thursday night our sixth grandchild was born .
<en=15>It was born to our son David and his wife Courtney .
<en=16>It was a 7 lb. , 10 oz. , 20 inch little boy .
<en=17>So we now have three grandsons and three granddaughters ranging from about 2 years - 4 months down to a few days .
<en=18>They are a great deal of fun .
<en=19>We are doing quite well .
<en=20>I am looking forward to seeing Ginger " Rees " Copeland when she comes to Houston .
<en=21>I would be delighted to arrange tickets for you and your family should you ever have occasion to visit Houston .
<en=22>I hope you have a great summer .
<en=23>Thank you for your recent request for Mr. Lay to speak at your conference .
<en=24>Unfortunately , do to Mr. Lay 's schedule he will not be able to participate .
<en=25>Thank you again ,
<en=26>Tori L. Wells Executive Secretary
<en=27>Hi -
<en=28>Just to let you know that it looks like one day will work .

<en=32>Dear Ken ,
<en=33>As you know , our next meeting is on Wednesday , July 12 from 3:00 - 5:30 p.m .
<en=34>In the next week or so , we 'll be sending around a discussion paper which we hope crystallizes the issues , and we will try to talk to as many of you as possible before the meeting to go through it .
<en=35>Meanwhile , Arthur Levitt has agreed to meet with us in September to brainstorm on the ideas we 've generated and also to give us a sense of some of the issues as he sees them .
<en=36>There are three possible dates for the meeting , which I suggest be in two parts -- first , a meeting among the panel only from 5:00 - 6:30 p.m. , and then a dinner with Chairman Levitt from 6:30 - 8:30 p.m .
<en=37>Here are the dates :
<en=38>Could you please let us know which of these would be possible for you :
<en=39>___________ Thursday , September 14 5:00 - 8:30 pm
<en=40>___________ Monday , September 25 5:00 - 8:30 pm
<en=41>___________ Wednesday , September 27 5:00 - 8:30 pm
<en=42>Many thanks ,
