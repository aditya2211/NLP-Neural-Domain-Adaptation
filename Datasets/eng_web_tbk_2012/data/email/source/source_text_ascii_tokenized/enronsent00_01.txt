<en=1>Michael :
<en=2>Thanks for putting the paperwork together .
<en=3>I would have interest in meeting if you can present unique investment opportunities that I do n't have access to now .
<en=4>Most of my contact with financial advisors in the past has consisted of them suggesting a mutual fund , telling me to invest in Home Depot , Sun , and Coke , or trying to pass off their banks ' biased research reports as something valuable .
<en=5>The above services provide no value to me personally .
<en=6>If you can present opportunities such as access to private equity or hedge funds , or other ideas with strong growth potential and low correlation to the S@P , I 'd listen .
<en=7>John
<en=8>John -
<en=9>We 'll get the paperwork together and sent to you for naked options .
<en=10>At some point , I 'd like to talk about the diversification strategy in more detail -- perhaps over dinner or a quick meeting after the markets close ?

<en=12>Michael :
<en=13>Appreciate the idea .
<en=14>However , with my natural long , I 'm not looking to really trade around the position .
<en=15>I believe ENE will continue to be range bound , but in case it is not , I do n't want to forgo 50 % of my option premium .
<en=16>I have price targets of where I would like to lighten up exposure to ENE and will use calls to implement the stategy .
<en=17>To that regards , I noticed I was not approved to sell naked calls .
<en=18>I would like that ability in order to hedge some exposure I have of unexercised vested options .
<en=19>Please look into that for me .
<en=20>John .
<en=21>John -
<en=22>I was looking at the recent pullback in ENE and thinking it might be an opportunity to buy back the calls you sold .
<en=23>Of course , you would then be in a position to sell calls again if the stock makes a bounce .
<en=24>I 'm not sure that ENE @ 75 is the place , but maybe @ 73 .
<en=25>Call me if you 're interested .
