<en=1>You have always been on the move seeking affectionate , satisfying and harmonious relationships .
<en=2>Your ultimate goal has been the realisation of an intimate union in which there could be love , self - sacrifice and mutual trust .
<en=3>It has often been said that " True love is just around the corner " ... and maybe ... if you have n't found it as yet - you possibly soon will .
<en=4>In the past there have been .. and maybe there still are many things that you have had to do without .
<en=5>You have now decided to set your sights on a position or situation that could give you greater prestige and which will afford you considerable self esteem .
<en=6>You wear your heart on your sleeve ... and since you are an emotional person you are apt to give your all ... heart and soul ... to all those that show you a little affection ... but take care ... it would appear that you have been extremely hurt in the past ... and you keep leaving yourself wide open for punishment ..
<en=7>Whatever you strive to do , something always seems to be holding you back .
<en=8>There is no subterfuge in you .
<en=9>You are a clear thinker and all you demand from life , in a relationship , is a partner whom you can trust and with whom you can , together , develop a foundation of trust based on understanding .
<en=10>You are your own person ... and you demand freedom of thought ... to follow your own convictions .
<en=11>You have no interest in " two - timing " and all you seek is sincerity and " straight - dealing " .
<en=12>You wish to be left in peace ... no more conflict and no more differences of opinion ...
<en=13>In fact you just do n't want to be involved in any arguments of any shape or form ...
<en=14>All you want is for " them " to get on with it - and to leave you alone ..
