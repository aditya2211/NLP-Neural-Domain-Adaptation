<en=76>I am forwarding to you guidelines prepared for global products trading .
<en=77>It 's a good starting point .
<en=78>I am currently working on guidelines for Argentina which will address both physical and financial trading .
<en=79>Other " guidelines " exist in limited form for the remote offices in Singapore and Australia .
<en=80>I am checking on London .
<en=81>I 'm not exactly certain as to what you are looking for .
<en=82>Obviously the foreign offices have issues that may not apply in the US ( although LA. is about as close as you can get to a third world country ) .
<en=83>One thing that does n't show up in the attachment is the swap eligibility issue .
<en=84>Let me know how I can help further .

<en=88>Here it is -- we printed this 2 - sided and laminated it .
<en=89>Becky will bring you the hard copy version .
<en=90>Lunch date later .
<en=91>see below .
<en=92>It looks like the 2 - day L/C issue is an issue .
<en=93>I 'll call you shortly .
<en=94>Joseph Manogue at Tiger called me last night to say he had finally reviewed the draft ISDA doc with all agreed changes put in and lined from original .
<en=95>He faxed it to you and will have the original Fedexed overnight .
<en=96>Hope you 'll have time to review it today .
<en=97>S&S has again asked about the gtee and l/c wording .
<en=98>They do not have anything from us in writing confirming the agreed changes .
<en=99>Joe asked that you fax the revised gtee wording that has been agreed ( I believe it was our agreeing to reduce the claim period from 15 days down to 5 ) and the new l/c wording ( drops the 2 day period to replace an l/c with a different bank if the first refuses to pay ) .
<en=100>I know we talked about these issues earlier , but Tiger 's lawyers want to get everything agreed in writing now so final docs can be issued for signing , even if we are the one's issuing the gtee and l/c .
<en=101>Thanks !
<en=102>Call if you have questions or if I can be of any help .
<en=103>There is an outside chance we could have everything set to go this week .
<en=104>With best regards ,
