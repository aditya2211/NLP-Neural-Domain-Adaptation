<en=106>I do not think the prior e-mail got through to Kay .
<en=107>Are either of you familiar with this project ?
<en=108>We have had no contact with the ENA / Enron Mexico commercial or legal people and I do n't want to bust any structuring goals .
<en=109>Our project manager ( Scott Laidlaw ) and engineer ( Harry Okabayashi ) want to issue a tasking letter to procure engineering services on this project to support the ENA work .
<en=110>I now understand that someone at ENA / Enron Mexico / Enron Wholesale has signed an EPC contract with ABB for this project .
<en=111>I am not in the office today , so please include Renee Alfaro on your response .
