<en=1>daily dose on enron -
<en=2>we are finished .
<en=3>i need to now get a job at house of pies b/c that is the only way to pay the bills .
<en=4>the economy is down and when enron collapses , the energy industry is going to be in a world of hurt .
<en=5>not to mention the market is going to be flooded with enron folks .
<en=6>ca n't go to any more lsu games unless i get a free ticket .
<en=7>Since work has gone to hell , I am hoping to find some excitement in the possibility that LSU may play in the Cotton Bowl ( if Rohan " Alabama " Davey shows up for the next 3 games . )
<en=8>However , do not purchase tickets until it is a done deal - a lesson I learned following the Ark game last season .
