<en=1>Maureen ,
<en=2>Andre is going to look over the list of curves needed for the global assets ( August Board meeting ) one more time before I forward it to you .
<en=3>He will make sure that we do not request FX and inflation ( CPI , PPI , etc. ) curves when only one of the curves will actually be used in the valuation process and to determine which inflation index is needed .
<en=4>Typically , we receive both FX and inflation from you , but both curves may not always be used .
<en=5>I hope that we can give you some time savings by eliminating any nonessential requests .
<en=6>For now , this is the list of countries for which we will probably need the FX and / or inflation curves .
<en=7>I will send the specifics per Andre later today .
<en=8>India
<en=9>Philippines
<en=10>Bolivia
<en=11>Jamaica
<en=12>Guatemala
<en=13>Venezuela
<en=14>Columbia
<en=15>Puerto Rico CPI only ( I need historical inflation data , as well )
<en=16>Panama
<en=17>Brazil we have current data already
<en=18>China we have current data already
<en=19>Euro inflation only
<en=20>I am not certain about the needs for the London Underwriting / IV group but will request the information from them if you have not done so already .
<en=21>Thanks !

<en=49>FYI

<en=51>Anne , Mike will call you regarding Sarah .
<en=52>Vince ,
<en=53>As I mentioned in my voice mail , Mike Roberts going to hire Sara Woody , a recent MBA grad from Rice , into his group .
<en=54>However , when we were talking about this position , Mike compared Sara to Elena .
<en=55>Elena 's title is admin coordinator , and I know that Sara should not have this title , and honestly do not think that Elena should also .
<en=56>Admin coordinator's do primarily administrative work .
<en=57>I suggest that you compare Elena and Sarah 's duties / level to other Sr. Spec. in your group such as Kenneth Parkhill and Sevil to determine if they are equivalent , or if their scope of responsibilities and experience is not as broad .
<en=58>If the latter is the case , we could place both Sara and Elena in a specialist job group ( the salary range is 33 - 66 K ) .
<en=59>Please advise .
<en=60>Thanks ,
<en=61>Anne
<en=62>Clayton ,
<en=63>Thanks a lot .
<en=64>I appreciate all your help .
<en=65>Vince
<en=66>Vince -
<en=67>Good news .
<en=68>Martin 's box is working wonderfully - I 'll have everything transferred to it and give him the keys by Friday .
<en=69>This was ( another ) nice deal for Enron .
<en=70>We save $ 21,000 in real money this way , the cash refund Sun is giving Enron for our other server , using a box that was n't being used by anyone .
<en=71>I 'm happy about this .
<en=72>Clayton
<en=73>Iris ,
<en=74>Congratulations .
<en=75>Anne , please , include this info in Iris ' file
