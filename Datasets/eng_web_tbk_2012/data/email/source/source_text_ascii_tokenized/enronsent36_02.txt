<en=3>what do you think ?
<en=4>Joe_Lardy@cargill.com on 03/02/2001 10:39:03 AM
<en=5>Currently Cargill and Enron have a 15 MM collateral threshold .
<en=6>If possible , I think the cleanest way to run this biz would be to put a box around the prime broker biz .
<en=7>We would still operate under the master isda but could set up a mutually agreeable credit support annex for this biz .
<en=8>We would still keep the 20,000,000 line referenced in Schedule B of the POA agreement .
<en=9>The line in the POA is a seperate and distinct measure from the daily collateral .
<en=10>The 20 mill reflects gross exposure .
<en=11>Let me know if you think this is reasonable and workable .
<en=12>We too , are open to suggestion as the Global and Enron relationships are very important and a high priority to us .
<en=13>Thanks

<en=15>Joe -
<en=16>a few things regading the POA / Cargill line ..
<en=17>I am going to find out how much line we currently have available ... you probably already have this .
<en=18>We should allocate a piece to Global which would solve the problem of other Cargill people using the line , putting us over the limit , without me knowing ...
<en=19>We could change the language of the POA to this ...
<en=20>we will not go over Global 's piece of the Cargill line ...
<en=21>I think this would solve our main concern ...
<en=22>Please let me know ... we are eager to keep trading with Global and yourselves ...
<en=23>Regards ,

<en=71>Sara :
<en=72>We need to change the Prod Description fro the LME Product .
<en=73>The change is mainly on the Settlement Date text , which instead of " ... Two business days after the date of the Transaction ... " shall read as follow :
<en=74>For Curr LME LME ( Spot ) 01 Mar 01 JPY / USD
<en=75>A currency Transaction with Enron Europe Finance & Trading Limited ( " EEFTL " ) as agent for Risk Management & Trading Corp. under which either ( A ) for the case in which Counterparty submits an offer to buy from EEFTL , Counterparty shall receive the Base Currency Amount and shall pay the Foreign Currency Amount , or ( B ) for the case in which Counterparty submits an offer to sell to EEFTL , Counterparty shall pay the Base Currency Amount and shall receive the Foreign Currency Amount .
<en=76>The Base Currency Amount shall equal the volume submitted by the Counterparty via the Website .
<en=77>The Foreign Currency Amount shall equal the Base Currency Amount , multiplied by the daily London Metal Exchange ( LME ) fixing rate as published by Reuters on page MTLE on the date of the transaction , modified by the price submitted by the Counterparty via the Website .
<en=78>The term of the Transaction shall correspond to the date ( s ) set forth in the Product description on the Website .
<en=79>The Settlement date shall be the date ( s ) set forth in the Product description on the Website .
<en=80>The price is quoted in JPY ( the ' Foreign Currency ' ) per US Dollar ( the ' Base Currency ' ) .
<en=81>The unit of measure against which the price is quoted shall be US Dollars .
<en=82>Please let me know your approval before we make any changes .
