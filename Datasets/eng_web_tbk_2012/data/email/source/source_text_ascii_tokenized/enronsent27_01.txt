<en=1>Virginia ,
<en=2>Hello .
<en=3>I was originally inquiring about purchasing a Cross or Signac impressionist lithograph .
<en=4>I found them and purchased both from a gallery in London , William Weston .
<en=5>They should be delivered this week .
<en=6>They are beautiful and will add a lot to our collection .
<en=7>By the way the Lichtenstein is up and hanging in our formal living room and it is magnificent .
<en=8>I have also purchased an Appel in the last month .
<en=9>I am interested in several artists .
<en=10>Actually , a lot .
<en=11>I will be looking for one or more of the following .
<en=12>My concept is that over time I would like to own one of all the following artists and they are all depending when I find something that we really like .
<en=13>I listed all of our ( sometimes mine vs. my wife 's favorites and priorities ) .
<en=14>They are kind of in rank order but as I stated if I find the piece that I like we will purchase it .
<en=15>I want signed and numbered .
<en=16>I realize that some were not signed by the artist but it is an important fact in my buying decision .
<en=17>I also realize that some may not have done any works on paper or they are outrageously expensive .
<en=18>For example , I would like to know if Rothko or Kline did any work on paper .
<en=19>At least that is what I am thinking now .
<en=20>Bonnard ( colorful only )
<en=21>Lautrec
<en=22>Suerat ( any works on paper ? -
<en=23>I do n't know that he did any )
<en=24>Other impressionist or post impressionist lithos
<en=25>Braque
<en=26>Moore
<en=27>Arp
<en=28>Rouault
<en=29>Modrian
<en=30>Rothko
<en=31>Kline
<en=32>Motherwell
<en=33>By the way , I am interested in re-looking at a Picasso ( although we have 2 ) that your gallery had a couple of years ago .
<en=34>It was a cubist piece from the 1920s and I believe you called the technique a " push wa " ( pronunciation Vs an attempt at the proper spelling ) .
<en=35>It was for sale in a couple of galleries in SF and was about $ 20,000 .
<en=36>Is there 1 available ?
<en=37>Also I am still thinking about the Matisse we discussed before but as you can see , I have a lot of other artists I am interested in and it may remain on the back burner because we already have one .
<en=38>Thanks ,
