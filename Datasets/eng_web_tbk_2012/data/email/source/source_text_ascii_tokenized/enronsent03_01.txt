<en=64>To Whom It May Concern :
<en=65>Through TV and newspapers , I hear constantly about identity fraud using stolen social security information .
<en=66>I am very concerned about this issue .
<en=67>I have the following suggestion for our company .
<en=68>Since Enron 's employees are assigned an SAP identification numbers ( P number ) and an HR number , could Enron as a company use these IDs instead of the SS numbers ?
<en=69>This will be safer for all employees .
<en=70>For example , I am concerned when I buy the monthly bus passes and I have to fill in my SS number .
<en=71>I do not feel secure at all to see my SS in so many databases at Enron , especially when some databases are from third - parties ( out - sourcing ) .
<en=72>We could use our badge number there instead of our SS .
<en=73>Please let me know how your organization can help the Enron employees feel safer about the safeguard of their SS number .
<en=74>Please calendar and print for my files on this meeting .
<en=75>Thanks .

<en=139>FYI re : NEPCO picketing issues .
<en=140>Michelle
<en=141>Michelle ,
<en=142>Two in one day .
<en=143>We understand that the pipe fitters are also planning to picket the Lake Worth , Florida project as well .
<en=144>Our execution team needs to get some guidance and planning for this picketing should it interfere with the progress of the work .
<en=145>In that respect , we need to dial in Rick Johnson and Olgletree to plan and communicate that plan to the execution team .
<en=146>I think the first step is a call between yourself , me , Mark Stubley and Mike Indivero .
<en=147>And then another call with all folks or a meeting at the jobsite to lay out the plan .
<en=148>Barbara , please organize a call for Mike , Michelle , Mark Stubley and me .
<en=149>Thanks .
<en=150>David ,
<en=151>I have been advised by our Construction Manager , Mr. Joe Osler that while he was visiting the City of Lake Worth Building Planning and Zoning dept regarding our permit status he learned that the pipefitters have inquired about permit requirements to picket our site .
<en=152>Apparently the City informed them that no permit is required .
<en=153>I have heard that the pipefitters have established a picket line at the Payne Creek site today .
<en=154>We will need local legal counsel to assist us in this regard .
<en=155>Mike Indivero , I understand that Mr. Mike Croall 's release date from NEPCO is Oct 31 , 2001 .
<en=156>Please advise as to who his replacement is and their report date .
<en=157>Thanks ,
