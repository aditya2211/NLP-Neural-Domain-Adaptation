<en=44>The positions needed to be divided to reflect BCF 's .
<en=45>Thanks
<en=46>Kam
<en=47>could you also CC me the first few times you send it ?
<en=48>While our established schedules of Tuesday and Friday DPR's would have us reporting tomorrow 's activity on Monday , we will change that for month end .
<en=49>Please email the January 31st DPR information for your respective groups to my attention by noon on Friday .
<en=50>You should use the same spreadsheet format used for the 1/29/02 DPR .
<en=51>All p&l and PRMA numbers should be in $ '000's .
<en=52>Starting in February , you will be able to export the data , as opposed to using the spreadsheets .
