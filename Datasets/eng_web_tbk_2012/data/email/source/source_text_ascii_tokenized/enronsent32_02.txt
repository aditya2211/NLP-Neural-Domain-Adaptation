<en=5>Seriously , I talked this morning with Tom Hall and we agreed that Ecogas would pay him $ 53,000 .

<en=26>I agree with Steve 's position stated in his separate e'mail .
<en=27>Do n't give these guys a penny .
<en=28>---- cgy
<en=29>Tracy , Do we have concerns here .
<en=30>We pointed out to the PX that there was excess credit .
