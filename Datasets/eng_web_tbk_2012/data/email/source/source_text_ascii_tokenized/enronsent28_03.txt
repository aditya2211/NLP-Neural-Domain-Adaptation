<en=3>On or about September 23 , 1999 a request for service was placed by the above referenced counterparty .
<en=4>The request was for a Intrastate Gas Transportation Agreement and 311 Gas Transportation Agreement .
<en=5>These agreements were forwarded to the counterparty , CCNG , Inc. .
<en=6>On or about October 6 , 1999 , Kelly Cloud , Senior Vice President of CCNG , Inc. ( 713 ) 235-1972 , called and informed me that the counterparty should be CCGM , L.P. .
<en=7>Further , she informed me that Section 7 of the agreement , which reads in part : Gas is free from liens and adverse claims of every kind , should be changed because the gas that the counterparty will be transporting on HPL may and / or is subject to liens .
<en=8>She was instructed to destroy the agreement and another would be forwarded to her with the necessary corrections and re-wording of Section 7 .
<en=9>Attached find the agreements for the necessary changes in Section 7 .
<en=10>Kelly
<en=11>Cloud has instructed me to call with any further questions .
<en=12>Thanks .
