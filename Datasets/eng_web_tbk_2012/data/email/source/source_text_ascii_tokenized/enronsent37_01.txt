<en=34>fyi
<en=35>Tom Byargeon , Kevin Miller and Ken Loch in ENA are working with producers in the US involved in deep water offshore Louisiana / Texas oil and gas drilling projects .
<en=36>This financing activity was primarily started to help ENA secure long term well head and pipeline natural gas supplies to supplement the gas trading desk activities .
<en=37>Just like what happened in Enron 's initial VPP program they are find more interest in oil drilling projects rather than natural gas projects .
<en=38>They are currently working on a bid ( due 1/31 ) for the Medusa project which involves Murphy ( operator ) , Agip and Callon in Mississippi Canyon Blocks # 538 and # 582 .
<en=39>The initial reservoir reports estimate reserves of 80 - 120 million barrels of sour crude and they estimate initial production to be 40,000 bpd starting in 1Q 2003 .
<en=40>Quality is estimated to be a Mars type crude with 25 - 27 API Gravity and 1.5 - 2.0 % sulfur .
<en=41>Plans are to build a private pipeline to Equilon 's West Delta # 143 platform and then bring the oil onshore .
<en=42>Peggy is finding out where WD # 143 pumps to onshore .
<en=43>Tom 's group would like to know if we have any interesting in buying the crude on either a fixed or floating basis .
<en=44>The floating could be tied to a Platt 's index or the NYMEX .
<en=45>It is far too early to expect Murphy to enter into a physical or financial contract , but Tom hopes to get us first and / or last look from Murphy when the time is right .
<en=46>Another alternative is to give Murphy barrels at their 95,000 bpd Meraux , Louisiana refinery in exchange for the new production barrels .
<en=47>Could someone in your group please give me a notional non binding basis differential for this quality of crude for Cal 2003 ?

<en=51>Please address , and I 'll check with Legal as well .
<en=52>We typically only book deals when everything is signed off .

<en=56>following up on our discussion yesterday ; for these types of deals , i do nt think it s necessary to have all the documentation of our counterparty 's authorization to enter into the agreement .
<en=57>these are short term transactions and requiring this documentation will cause us to lose business because competitive alternatives do not have such burdensome requirements .
<en=58>the primary reason we need these things is for the scenario where a muni does a derivative deal with an open - ended downside , loses $ 50 million , and then claims that it was not a valid contract .
<en=59>in our case , they are only hedging .
<en=60>we are collecting a premium up front and their total cost is known up front .
<en=61>therefore they will not attempt to make this claim .
<en=62>even if they did , our risk is limited to the premium , not some big payout .
<en=63>the risk of losing business is far greater than the risk of a counterparty trying to get their premium back .
<en=64>seems like a 5 second decision to me .
<en=65>is it possible to combine the standard isda and our confirm into a single long form ?
<en=66>by going away from the standard isda maybe we can eliminate these requirements because the payout liability is only 1 - way .

<en=80>Yikes !
<en=81>That girl 's mother sounds like a real problem .
<en=82>I 'm not sure how I would have handled it .
<en=83>How 's school going ?
<en=84>Any plans for the weekend ?

<en=86>01/26/2001 11:36 AM
<en=87>What happened ?
<en=88>Here 's a story ... as I was waiting at the bus stop ( 7:35 am ) to go to school , a lady approached me and asked if I 'd make sure her daughter got on a certain bus .
<en=89>The mother was running late for work and could not wait .
<en=90>I could n't say no ... so Nicki ( the little girl - 10 yrs. old ) and I waited for the bus .
<en=91>It was now , 8:15 and there was no sign of her bus .
<en=92>On top of things , I had quiz at 8 am .
<en=93>Which I then realized I missed .
<en=94>I decided that Nicki would just have to wait on her own .
<en=95>I asked her if she had any relatives that would want to know of her whereabouts .
<en=96>I called her grandmother and explained things to her .
<en=97>Pretty strange ... aye .
<en=98>A bus that runs through UofH arrived and I almost got on without her , but I could n't do it .
<en=99>Finally , I told the little girl that she would have to accompany me to school ( 8:30 am ) .
<en=100>There were only 15 minutes left of class .
<en=101>I stayed for the remainder of the lecture .
<en=102>After class we went back to bus stop and within minutes her bus arrived .
<en=103>I told the bus driver where to drop her off .
<en=104>I notified her grandmother with the time of the departure .
<en=105>And I was relieved when Nicki called to let me know she was home safe .
<en=106>Please send the memo to the EGM business heads as well .
<en=107>Thanks .

<en=119>All ,
<en=120>The Analyst and Associate Programs recognize we have many Analyst needs that need to be addressed immediately .
<en=121>While we anticipate many new Analysts joining Enron this summer ( late May ) and fulltime ( August ) we felt it necessary to address some of the immediate needs with an Off - Cycle Recruiting event .
<en=122>We are planning this event for Thursday , February 15 and are inviting approximately 30 candidates to be interviewed .
<en=123>I am asking that you forward this note to any potential interviewers ( Managers or above ) .
<en=124>We will conduct first round interviews in the morning and the second round interviews in the afternoon .
<en=125>We need for interviewers to commit either to the morning ( 9 am - 12 pm ) or afternoon ( 2 pm - 5 pm ) complete session .
<en=126>Please submit your response using the buttons below and update your calendar for this date .
<en=127>In addition , we will need the groups that have current needs to commit to taking one or more of these Analysts should they be extended an offer .
<en=128>Thanks in advance for your cooperation .
<en=129>Thank you ,
<en=130>Jana
