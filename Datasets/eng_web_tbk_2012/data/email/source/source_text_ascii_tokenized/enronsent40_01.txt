<en=22>It does n't sound like he can receive visitors yet .
<en=23>A .
<en=24>Thanks for the heads up .?
<en=25>Do you know the address to send cards ??

<en=42>I think it 's a good idea since the provisional application is on file - Travis is the internal lawyer who has taken care of the patent application so he will have better ideas for where the words should be placed and appropriate look and feel ( I would guess near the copyright notice and roughly equivalent size ) .

<en=45>Mark ,
<en=46>We are thinking of adding a Patent Pending message to key EnronOnline pages ( like the homepage ) .
<en=47>Can you offer comments / concerns / guidelines ?
<en=48>Dave
<en=49>Does it make sense for us to set up a meeting with you participating from Buenos Aires ?
<en=50>I 'm not sure we have much to tell them at this stage - actually , I 'm sure I do n't have anything new to report but if you do that would be fine with me .

<en=72>If you need more , there is a proposal from the documentation committee for a new alternative for calculating termination amounts ( we heard about it in Amsterdam ) that I think will be particularly attractive to the energy markets .
<en=73>I do n't know where this stands officially ( I have n't heard any developments since Amsterdam ) but I can find out from Bob Pickle if you want .
<en=74>Mark E Haedicke
<en=75>07/18/2000 08:58 AM
<en=76>We should include ISDA energy definitions , CFTC matters re energy and an overview of power deregulation developments in North America .
<en=77>I might also add a few items about international developments and the EEI physical power trading form .
<en=78>I am thinking 4 slides at the most .
<en=79>Is that what you want ?
