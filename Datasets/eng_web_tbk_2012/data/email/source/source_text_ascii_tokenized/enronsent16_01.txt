<en=4>Dear Justin
<en=5>Marly asked me to respond to you .
<en=6>As you know , the suffix ONLINE is purely descriptive and now used by many companies .
<en=7>Therefore , any trade mark registration that incorporates the word ONLINE as a suffix in the way that you use it will not enable its owner to prevent others from using the word ONLINE .
<en=8>Given the above , if you have adequate protection for the word ENRON ( which covers the services that you offer on - line as well as your core activities ) , I 'd say that another application for the words ENRON ONLINE is probably unnecessary .
<en=9>However , if you use a particular logo for the on - line service , that should be registered .
<en=10>I hope the above is clear .
<en=11>Jonathan Day
<en=12>Marly ,
<en=13>If you could respond to me on this request , thanks
<en=14>Justin

<en=17>Can one of you give me a quick call to discuss .
<en=18>I 'm @ X37047 .
<en=19>Thanks .
<en=20>I believe we are to some extent already protected with " Enron " proceeded with anything , but EnronOnline ( TM ) , etc. just affords us more protection .
<en=21>I assume this is akin to why McDonald 's trademarks " Mc " Everything ?

<en=24>Paul ,
<en=25>Can you please give me a call to discuss trademarking ?
<en=26>i.e. Are we covered if we proceed a word with " Enron " ?
<en=27>e.g. : EnronEAuction .
<en=28>If we are covered , then was it necessary to register EnronOnline ?
<en=29>Thanks ,
<en=30>Dave

<en=36>Per my conversation with Edmund this morning , we are moving the following countries to the non-approved list : Austria , Belgium , Croatia , Czech Republic , Denmark , Poland , Portugal , Romania , Singapore , and Slovenia .
<en=37>Below is the list , now updated to reflect this change .
<en=38>Jurisdictions which are are approved to trade credit derivatives : Finland , Germany , Norway , Sweden , Switzerland , the U.K , and the U.S. .
<en=39>Jurisdictions which are not approved to trade credit derivatives include : Austria , Belgium , Canada , Croatia , Czech Republic , Denmark , France , Gibraltar , Ireland , Italy , Poland , Portugal , Romania , Scotland , Singapore , Slovenia , Spain , and The Netherlands .
<en=40>For banks incorporated in a non-approved jurisdiction , it may be possible for them to trade out of a branch located in an approved jurisdiction ( i.e. U.S. and U.K. branches ) .
<en=41>This would have to be determined on a case by case basis .
<en=42>Please let me know if there are any changes to this list .
<en=43>Sent by : Nella Cappelletto
<en=44>Yes , we should add compliance with OTC Derivatives and / or Commodity Contracts and Qualified Party requirements of the Securities Act ( Alberta ) , Securities Act ( British Columbia ) and Securities Act ( Ontario ) .
<en=45>Thanks ,
<en=46>Peter
<en=47>With regard to our annual review of this list of laws we need to comply with , do we not want to add the Canadian provinces new " eligible swap participant " equivalant rules ?

<en=53>You are the best !
<en=54>Why does it always have to be my deals ...?!!!
<en=55>We 've received a personal invitation to a NYMEX Crawfish Boil on April 3 at 5:00 at Garden in the Heights at 3926 Feagan .
<en=56>The cause of this celebration is the 10th anniversary of the Nat Gas futures contract .
<en=57>It would be nice if Shankman and John Arnold could attend .
<en=58>Perhaps you can give them a personal invitation ...
<en=59>We have received the amendment to the BC Gas ISDA Master executed by BC Gas , which adds the Canadian Securities Representation , so we do n't have to add the rep into every confirm .
<en=60>BC Gas wo n't sign the confirms with the rep in , and this has caused much difficulties .
<en=61>I am going to count it as signed , since BC Gas has signed , but we still need it to be signed by ECC .
<en=62>Can you get it signed ASAP and back to me .
<en=63>Much thanks .
<en=64>We have received the executed Amendment to the Subscription Agreement with WeatherTrade , Inc. dated March 2 , 2000 .
<en=65>This Amendment amends the Transaction Fee referenced in subparagraph ( c ) of the Fee Schedule to the Subscription Agreement .
<en=66>Copies will be distributed .
<en=67>Updating another blue file because Susan B. , this time , has not updated it to reference mergers & name changes !
<en=68>It appears you missed some cpys on the referenced list because Tom had the freeze panel button on , and you probably did n't see them at first .
<en=69>I did n't either until I clicked on the down button and they popped up .
<en=70>When you have a minute , I 'll give me a call and I 'll come around and show you how to unfreeze the panel .
<en=71>I spoke to Edmund to get the scoop on what we are going to be doing on the confirms for Credit Derivatives , and he said that his current understanding is that all of the confirms will be done out of London .
<en=72>I communicated that to Bob Bowen .
<en=73>He also said that London was going to be hiring 120 people to deal with the Credit Derivatives business .
<en=74>Wow !
<en=75>Carol , will you handle this or Mark ?
