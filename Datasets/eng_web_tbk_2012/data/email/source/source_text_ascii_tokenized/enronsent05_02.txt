<en=11>Confidential Settlement Document Per CPUC Rule 51
<en=12>Gas Accord II Settlement Participants :
<en=13>Attached is PG&E 's Gas Accord II ( GA II ) Settlement Proposal .
<en=14>We believe it addresses many of the issues and concerns you have raised in the workshops .
<en=15>As an overview , this proposal : * Maintains the basic Gas Accord structure in place today for the period 2003 to 2007 . *
<en=16>* Offers end user transportation rates for 2003 lower for most customers than rates in effect today . *
<en=17>* Provides for vintaged Redwood path rates for core customers . *
<en=18>* Offers a 7.5 cent / dth rate to large customers while minimizing rate changes to other customers , minimizing the incentive for these customers to seek to bypass local transmission charges and other CPUC - approved charges . *
<en=19>* Adopts guidelines to improve reliability and help moderate prices in gas commodity markets , and identifies the capital projects needed to meet these guidelines over the course of the GA II period ( 2003 - 2007 ) . *
<en=20>* Provides a high degree of rate stability , with a 3.5 % escalator to capture both inflation and the cost of needed capital projects .
<en=21>The guaranteed rates will be adjustable only for significant changes in the cost of capital or increased costs due to governmental requirements or catastrophic events . *
<en=22>* Preserves a rate differential between the Redwood and Baja paths , although somewhat less than the current differential . *
<en=23>* Proposes a two - stage open season for firm transportation services beginning in 2003 , with end users receiving a first option on available capacity . *
<en=24>* Maintains the core aggregation program with some adjustments .
<en=25>PG&E also anticipates that the Core Procurement Incentive Mechanism ( CPIM ) will be similar to today 's mechanism , but will reflect the somewhat larger capacity holdings needed to meet anticipated increases in core demand and to meet a 1 - day in 10 - year cold weather event .
<en=26>This also will serve as a reminder that an all - Party meeting is scheduled at PG&E 's headquarters in San Francisco on January 10 and 11 , to discuss this proposal and to respond to your questions .
<en=27>We look forward to answering your questions and receiving your feedback .
<en=28>The attached documents include the GA II Settlement proposal , an Attachment ( a copy of PG&E 's proposed Gas Rule 27 ) , and a set of supporting workpapers .
<en=29>Finally , please note that the Settlement document and the Attachment are in " Word 2000 " format .
<en=30>We would be glad to provide the same documents in an earlier version of Word , upon request by individual Parties .
<en=31>We look forward to seeing you on January 10 - 11 .
<en=32>In the meantime , we extend our best wishes for a safe and happy holiday season .

<en=71>Jeff -
<en=72>instead of suggesting a specific rate increase - 10 or 15 % , I think we should acknowledge that a " modest " increase may be necessary and may in fact be desirable - but that the specific amount of increase should be reasoned and subject to well thought out evidence and hearings , not just determined by whim .
<en=73>In general , we should not be overly prescriptive at this point and I know you agree with that .
<en=74>Otherwise , I think you have captured the points excellently .
<en=75>We 're in the process of developing a strategy to take us through the next few months .
<en=76>But while the ( otherwise perishable ) thoughts are still fresh in my mind from the hearings on Monday and Tuesday , I wanted to throw out some observations for discussion in the days / weeks ahead .
<en=77>OBSERVATION -- The pressure to finger somebody for " price gouging " is increasing .
<en=78>The administration is hell bent on finding a " fall guy . "
<en=79>The price spikes pose real political risks for Davis and he and his folks need and want an easy way out .
<en=80>His press release following the hearing renewed the call for " refunds . "
<en=81>On my panel , Loretta Lynch asked Reliant and Duke to supply her with the details of the contracts they cut to sell their power forward to marketers .
<en=82>And Carl Wood 's remarks were extreme .
<en=83>At the Barton hearing , a liberal democrat ( Filner ) and a conservative Republican ( Hunter ) locked arms in calling for refunds .
<en=84>Bilbray joined the " gouging " band wagon .
<en=85>The utilities repeatedly called on FERC to do a " real " investigation , with hearings , testimony , data discovery --- the works .
<en=86>On the positive side , the FERC commissioners lauded Wolak , his analysis , and his remarks on the panel .
<en=87>Wolak said somewhat emphatically that the nature of California 's market structure makes it impossible to single out a single participant as the culprit .
<en=88>He also stated that just everyone 's just acting in their own self - interest , responding to the screwed incentives embedded in the structure .
<en=89>IMPLICATION -- It seems prudent for Enron to understand better its risks of getting fingered .
<en=90>In the best case , the clamoring for a " refund " subsides .
<en=91>In which case , the only cost to Enron is the internal cost incurred to understand better the risks of getting fingered .
<en=92>In the medium case , investigations find that Enron ( like others ) " played by the rules , " but the rules stunk , and Enron profited at the expense of California consumers .
<en=93>You 're right , Sue .
<en=94>Rates ca n't go up w/out declaring the rate freeze over in some fashion --- trying to finesse it .
<en=95>Thanks very much for the comments .
<en=96>Harry also had a good comment --- do n't specify the amount of rate increase in our comments ; rather note that the rate increase needs to be well - reasoned and based on facts and evidence .
<en=97>Will make that change .
