<en=86>Attached is a rough draft of my talking points for a panel I 'll be on at a CEM conference in SF on Thursday afternoon .
<en=87>Have distributed to Western GA team ( plus Steffes ) for comment and thought you may have some , too .
<en=88>Topic for panel , " PUC Priorities . "
<en=89>Goal is to ( politely ? ) refute Loretta Lynch 's and Carl Woods ' continued assertions that 1 ) California 's move to deregulate was based solely on ideology with no basis in fact and 2 ) the solution is to turn back the clock to command - and - control regulation .
<en=90>The FERC order tomorrow is likely to alter the points somewhat .
<en=91>Comments are much appreciated .
<en=92>Best ,
<en=93>Jeff
<en=94>Chris :
<en=95>As we discussed yesterday , Laird and I spoke and we think that the presentation is good to go for Thursday .
<en=96>We 'll need to update the numbers for the offer we made to S.D. last week .
<en=97>You had mentioned that you might want to include a shaped product .
<en=98>You still considering it ?
<en=99>Let us know and we can add it , and make any other changes you 'd like to make at this end .
<en=100>My flight gets into S.D. at at 8:35 on southwest .
<en=101>Best ,
