<en=4>Can you please review this additional language to the risk management policy ( or circulate to Jeff Hodge ) ?
<en=5>In light of the CA regarding curves , I am slightly concerned with a blanket statement essentially giving Peoples unlimited access to information .
<en=6>I know that we address audit rights in the LLC agreement so this may not matter anyway if this is a right they already have .
<en=7>Let me know what you think .
<en=8>Thanks ,

<en=16>I 'm still at home .
<en=17>I 'll be in tomorrow .
<en=18>I have a fax machine at home , though , if you prefer .
<en=19>Otherwise , we can see who we can scare up at the office , or you can have Laura sign and I 'll initial later .
<en=20>Which do you prefer ?
<en=21>Kay
<en=22>Are you in the office to initial signature pages today ?
<en=23>If not , is there someone else that will ?

<en=30>Hello -
<en=31>I spoke with Jeff Hodge yesterday regarding the additional language from Peoples regarding Audit Rights .
<en=32>His initial reaction was that their request was probably reasonable and in line with the spirit of a jointly owned L.L.C .
<en=33>However , he did suggest a couple slight revisions to protect Enron 's interests .
<en=34>1 ) Highlighting that information will only be provided that is related to enovate and 2 ) that each designated representative should sign an appropriate confidentiality agreement .
<en=35>This language has been included in the attached draft .
<en=36>My goal , however optimistic , is to execute the risk policy by the end of today .
<en=37>Activity is picking up dramatically and the fine line is getting further blurred each passing day .
<en=38>Therefore , I need to know ASAP if there are any problems with the draft as written .
<en=39>Otherwise , I will be sending it to Peoples as our final revision by mid morning .
<en=40>Thanks for your prompt attention to this .
<en=41>Thanks ,

<en=59>It is less complicated for me to initial and fax than to track down someone who does n't know anything about it and get them to initial it .
<en=60>I can print it here , initial it , and fax it to whomever you want .
<en=61>Plus , I work with Janet a lot so she may get some comfort from that , instead of having a lawyer she has n't dealt with initial it .
<en=62>She is very conscientious about what she signs , and who initials what .
<en=63>Is the attached form the final final form ?
<en=64>Where and to whom do you want it faxed ?
<en=65>Thanks ,
<en=66>Kay
<en=67>Since it will be Janet signing , it will probably be better to have the initials on the pages first .
<en=68>Either fax or someone else works fine .
<en=69>Let me know which is easier and we can coordinate .

<en=116>I 'm working on it now .
<en=117>Maybe we ( Enron ) could review it tomorrow morning , then send it to FCE .
<en=118>I can meet around 10:00 .
<en=119>That way , we can get it to them in time for weekend review .
<en=120>Does that work ?
