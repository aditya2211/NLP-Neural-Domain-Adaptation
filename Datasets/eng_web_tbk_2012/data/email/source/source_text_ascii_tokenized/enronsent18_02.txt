<en=9>Vince :
<en=10>I just wanted to check with you regarding the consulting arrangement we discussed a couple of weeks ago .
<en=11>Perhaps , we should start with just a 1 or 2 day contract where I give some thoughts to the kind of issues that we discussed and come to Houston to present my preliminary thoughts and possible avenues for additional work .
<en=12>regards ,

<en=61>Al ,

<en=65>Vince :
<en=66>Your suggestion to introduce the concept discussed with one of the Lays is welcomed .
<en=67>I hope that this would mean that you would remain involved at some level .
<en=68>The design of the model and its potential economics could be key to how worthy the effort might be .
<en=69>Enron could be an ideal environment from which to the concept enhancement through to commercialization could be successfully accomplished .
<en=70>Please confidentially share matters as you think best and advise me of the interest generated .
<en=71>I am ready to meet there at your building or elsewhere that is appropriate .
<en=72>Best regards ,
<en=73>Al Arfsten 713 965 2158
<en=74>Martin ,
<en=75>No problem .
<en=76>Please , ask Stinson as well .
<en=77>Vince
<en=78>I thought that since Chonawee has an optimization background , he would be good to have him go to dinner with Dr. Lasdon on Thrusday as well .
<en=79>Would this be fine ?
<en=80>Thanks ,
<en=81>Martin
