<en=10>Re : Cargill Ferrous International
<en=11>It was my understanding with the EOL Team that all divisions would have the legal incorporated entity as part of the name .
<en=12>Stephanie , I my preference is to kick their Password Application back and get them to change it to read something like " Cargill Ferrous International , a division of Cargill , Inc. " or " Cargill , Inc. acting through its Cargill Ferrous International Division " .

<en=65>We informed Tana that we made the change in Global Counterparty to include , " a division of Cargill Incorporated " .
<en=66>We will meet in the near future to discuss the issues surrounding division and trade name setups in Global Counterparty .

<en=69>If Sam 's description below of the GCP procedure is correct , it looks to me like something needs to be changed .
<en=70>The difficulty lies in the fact that the confirmation system reads the counterparty 's name from Global Counterparty .
<en=71>Since divisions of companies are not legal entities they do not have the power to contract in their own names .
<en=72>If the correct legal name is not in Global Counterparty , the confirmation goes out with the wrong legal name on it seriously compromising the contract itself .
<en=73>That is the source of Tana 's concern regarding the correct entering of divisions in the system .
<en=74>My suggestion is that Global Counterparty use the same name that the customer has signed on the EnronOnline Password Application -- my understanding is that the EnronOnline team returns inappropriate Applications to the customer until they are correctly completed .
<en=75>In this particular case since the counterparty is still not allowed to transact on EnronOnline almost a month after sending in their application they are understandably upset and are now complaining .
<en=76>I would appreciate it if you could get this one fixed today and , if you have any problem with changing the GCP procedure , please let me know .

<en=82>FYI ...
<en=83>Cargill Ferrous International is set up correctly in the Global Counterparty System as a Division of Cargill , Inc .
<en=84>Cargill Ferrous International is the full name of this division and set up as such in GCP with a Sub - to - Legal Link to Cargill , Inc. per GCP procedure .
<en=85>Also , the Global SAP team ( Cheryl Johnson ) would need Legal Name Change documentation from the Counterparty in order to change this name .
<en=86>Best Rgds .

<en=88>Any updates on adding the correct legal name to this counterparty name ?
<en=89>Hello ,
<en=90>Yes , GCP provides the links to establish the correlation between the parent and child for our downstream systems .
<en=91>GCP procedure is to create Counterparty names that reflect either the Tradename / Division name or Parent Name -- not both simultaneously .
<en=92>( Although , we have broken that rule for Legal in the past . )
<en=93>This defeats the purpose of using a Tradename .
