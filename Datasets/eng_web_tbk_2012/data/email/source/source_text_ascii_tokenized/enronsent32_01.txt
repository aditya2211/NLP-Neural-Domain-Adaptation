<en=2>As we discussed , here is a first effort at a revised TVA offer letter .
<en=3>I drafted the Into TVA Option as a series of calls tied to the MOPA delivery term and quantity - not sure if this anything close to what you all had in mind .
<en=4>Please let me know what shape you all think the offer ought to take and we can revise accordingly .
<en=5>Thanks

<en=31>Attached are clean and blacklined drafts of the Enron guaranties to be made in support of EPMI 's obligations under the Indian Mesa II Renewable Energy Purchase Agreement ( " PPA " ) and Green Premium Sharing Agreement ( " GSPA " ) .?
<en=32>The guaranty for the PPA is blacklined against the Enron EPC Contract guaranty in favor of the banks which was granted in connection with our Cabazon Wind Power Project ( the project most recently financed by EWC ) and the GPSA guaranty is blacklined against the PPA guaranty .
<en=33>As we discussed last week , since the Enron guaranties will need to be in a form that will acceptable to our project lenders and equity participants , we thought that we should start with a form that was used in our last financing and that was negotiated by Enron and the banks .
<en=34>We plan to use the same basic form for the Enron guaranty that will be made in favor of EPMI with respect to the seller 's obligations under the PPA .
<en=35>We will forward the draft of that guaranty to you later today .
<en=36>Please feel free to give me a call if you have any questions concerning the attached guaranties .
<en=37>Thank you .
