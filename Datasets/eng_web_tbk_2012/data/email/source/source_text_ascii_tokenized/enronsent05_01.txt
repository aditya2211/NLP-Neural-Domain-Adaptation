<en=3>All :
<en=4>It is my understanding , from good sources in the Gov s office that the Gov will order Loretta Lynch to expeditiously implement the provision to suspend all parties auhtority to enter into direct access contracts .
<en=5>The premise with which the administartion is acting is that if they expeditiously suspend everyone 's right to bilateral contracts quickly , it sets up a barrier which the direct access coalition must break through .
<en=6>In other words the table is set .
<en=7>Deal your meal from where the dishes are located .
<en=8>I.E. the Davis Administration wants to place all direct access advocates in the position of having to justify why each and every party should be the exception to the suspension rather than have a general rule concerning how direct access should work for all parties .
<en=9>It clearly gives the Admin a very strong upper hand to control who when and where direct access can occur without having to say that they oppose direct access .
<en=10>Power be where power lies .
