<en=3>John ,
<en=4>Hello from South America .
<en=5>I just got your email and I certainly concur with Jeff making the call .
<en=6>He has maintained a good relationship with Mulva .
<en=7>This was a risk that we had but we did have assurances from Phillips regarding performance .
<en=8>I do n't know how much it will help however .
<en=9>Richard Harper and Mary Nell Browning may have some ideas here but I am sure you 've already gone through it with them .
<en=10>I am amazed how the details get fuzzy on an old project .
<en=11>When you discussed it , i was trying to think back to our remedies and discussions but the 3 years have made it difficult .
<en=12>I do n't know if there is anything I can do but I 'm always willing to help .
<en=13>Good luck ,
<en=14>Mike
