<en=1>Hi everyone ,
<en=2>I just got of the phone with Hai and he told me how to make an adjustment on a day to day basis in regards to incorrect liquidations but he also explained this is just to make the daily P&L #'s right , if nothing were done the month end P&L would still somehow work out because adjustments would be made .
<en=3>Does this mean that for June and for a certain portion of July we should not do anything and just make adjustments on a going forward basis ( and assume everything will work out at month end ) ?
<en=4>If this is the case I would like someone to walk me through June to see if the numbers did really work themselves out as there was a large swing in second order on June 29 that was not adjusted for .
<en=5>Let me know if one of you could help me do this .
<en=6>Karim .
<en=7>Evidently , this a problem that Stacey White has been aware of for a couple of months now .
<en=8>There was a change made in the coding for the delta position and this has somehow messed up the liq value .

<en=10>John , Karim ,
<en=11>I 'm now looking closely at the option liquidation problems .
<en=12>I believe that there might be a sign - flipping problem for PUTS that 's causing this whole issue .
<en=13>I 'll keep you posted .
<en=14>Karim - this 's likely the explanation to your other question ...
<en=15>I 'll get back to you as soon as I have more info ( hopefully later today )

<en=17>The post id I am looking at for Calgary is 11608 .
<en=18>I am looking at the option liquidation report and all of the $ 65 puts are in the money and the $ 75 call is also in the money .
<en=19>Should n't all the liquidation values from the beginning of the month be a negative ( representing positive liquidation ) for the puts ?
<en=20>The liq value for the call is CORRECT .

<en=22>Karim ,
<en=23>I do n't want to wait till month end , let 's adjust the numbers now and for the June 29 2nd order , let s take that value into June since it relates to July puts .
