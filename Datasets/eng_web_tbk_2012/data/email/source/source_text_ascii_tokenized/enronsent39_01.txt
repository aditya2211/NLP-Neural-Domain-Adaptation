<en=47>Jean & Thane --
<en=48>Can we have a meeting this week ( maybe Thursday at 3:30 ) to discuss this ?
<en=49>Jim
<en=50>We do need a formal plan .
<en=51>We have been working closely together to identify the issues as they develop and propose solutions .
<en=52>Doug has been providing us with the necessary specific market information .
<en=53>We have been successful in communicating that information to the new commissioners and Ercot and seeking resolution .
<en=54>The commission is definitely more responsive to market participants that are articulating the issue , providing specific examples and proposing the solution .
<en=55>Grand - standing is ignored .
<en=56>Those who show up with complaints but can not point to specifics are virtually ignored .
<en=57>Those who show up and complain , but are not participating in the working groups and the daily Ercot phone calls , board meetings , etc. are ignored .
<en=58>Doug and I met with the Chairman of PUCT and have had subsequent conversations .
<en=59>Thane and I also visited with him .
<en=60>Pat Wood made a phone call to Tom Noel and told him to get the Texas market fixed .
<en=61>( Even though he has bigger things to do in D.C. , this is his legacy and he recognizes that if deregulation does not work in Texas , the repercussions could be global . )
<en=62>Chairman Sibley and Chairman Wolens ( of the Texas legislature ) are also engaged in market developments .
<en=63>We have been working with the State Affairs legislative committee and keeping them apprised .
<en=64>There is an Electric Restructuring Committee hearing scheduled for September 6th or 7th .
<en=65>The forum is expected to be invited testimony only .
<en=66>Those currently listed as invitees are PUCT Commissioners and Ercot 's Sam Jones and Tom Noel .
<en=67>The hearing is focused on the pilot and we have an opportunity to provide some probing questions for Wolens to direct to Sam and Tom .
<en=68>Now that Sibley is not a candidate for Lt. Governor , there is more freedom to open up and ask some difficult questions .
<en=69>Thane is in Austin on Friday , but is available by phone .
<en=70>I will be on a plane to Houston at 8:00 a.m .
<en=71>Can we find another time that works for us to meet ?
<en=72>Thane is in an Ercot PRS meeting Friday from 9:30 until 3:00 .
<en=73>I am available after Rick 's Friday budget meeting ... are you available then ?
<en=74>You are right , we do need a formal plan , Thane has started an initial draft .
<en=75>Thanks , Jean
<en=76>Jean & Thane --
<en=77>Walking out last night , Kevin Presto indicated that there were games being played in ERCOT with the new market rules and prices in certain markets were not reflective of working markets .
<en=78>Enron needs to use this situation to quickly get our viewpoints up into the PUCT and ERCOT ISO on what is driving these problems and our proposed fixes .
<en=79>If ERCOT goes the way of California - either due to market power or poor market design rules - it will be a bad day for deregulation and for Pat Wood .
<en=80>As important , the new PUCT Commissioners need some help right now in messaging the market .
<en=81>Let 's get them to support constructive solutions that will make a real difference .
<en=82>Jean and Thane , I think that we need a FORMAL PLAN on what to do over the next 3 - 6 months to leverage this situation .
<en=83>I would like to discuss this with you on Friday am .
<en=84>I am free at 8 am on Friday before Rick 's budget meeting .
<en=85>Jim
<en=86>FYI .
<en=87>You may want to discuss with Becky .
<en=88>Jim
<en=89>As an outgrowth of the meeting Leslie and I had with Scott and Hunter a couple of weeks ago , we have begun work to develop an electronic tool that would allow us to provide ongoing summaries of FERC gas activities , and possibly electric activities , in a format that can be linked to the Fundamentals intranet site used by the traders .
<en=90>We envision a format that would provide a brief summary and analysis of the order , filing , etc. with a link to the source document as well for those who would like more detailed information .
<en=91>This would replace the paper copies you and your people are currently getting .
<en=92>Many details remain to be worked out , but we will keep you advised .
<en=93>In the meantime , could you please provide a contact on your side with whom we could discuss technical issues ?
<en=94>What do I need to do ?
<en=95>Jim
