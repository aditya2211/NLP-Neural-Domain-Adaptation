<en=53>Ladies and gentlemen ,
<en=54>This is just to let you know that Emma gave birth at week 34 on Friday , 6th July , to our triplets :
<en=55>Benjamin James - at 12.45 pm - 3 lbs 4 ozs
<en=56>Toby William - 12.46 pm - 4 lbs
<en=57>Hannah May - 12.48 pm - 3 lbs 15 ozs .
<en=58>Although small , they are all " fully functioning " and very well - they are in the lowest level of special care ( and they will probably be in there for another two to four weeks ) until they can feed properly and maintain their weights .
<en=59>Emma is fine , too - very well !!
<en=60>All the best and kind regards
<en=61>Mark
<en=62>OOPS !
<en=63>Attached are the fax cover pages for each of the Nylon and Polykron Deemed ISDAs I just sent you .

<en=65>Rebecca :
<en=66>I am attaching a clean and blacklined version of the proposed resolutions authorizing the opening of brokerage accounts .
<en=67>I have attempted to revise them to make them clearer .
<en=68>Perhaps Jim Armogida can assist in revising them as I am sure he is more familiar with the way Enron Corp. likes their resolutions drafted than we are .
<en=69>Let me know if you have any questions or need anything else .

<en=91>Marie -
<en=92>per our conversation yesterday afternoon , attached are proposed drafts of the Schedule and the Para. 13 relative to the above .
<en=93>Having spoken with Dennis Goldmann , I am advised that there are currently 2 Guaranties in place in the sum of $ 8 M each : one by Niagara Mohawk Holdings Inc f / b / o Enron , and one by Enron Inc. f / b / o Niagara Mohawk Energy Marketing .
<en=94>I am told that our respective credit departments want to raise the credit lines to $ 10 M for each party , but to effect that we will have to modify the existing Guaranties accordingly .
<en=95>Let me know if this is your understanding , as well .
<en=96>After you have had the chance to review the attached , please send me a marked - up draft and we can discuss our concerns from there .
