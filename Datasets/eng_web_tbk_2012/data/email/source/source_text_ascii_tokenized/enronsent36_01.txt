<en=31>Hi Sara ,
<en=32>I just wanted to follow up on whether you will have a chance to send a draft Credit Support Annex ( similar in form to the one previously executed with ENA ) .
<en=33>I understand you may not have credit approval yet so perhaps we can leave the appropriate sections blank in the meantime .
<en=34>Thanks and regards ,
