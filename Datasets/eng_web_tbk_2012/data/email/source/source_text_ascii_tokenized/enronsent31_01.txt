<en=51>Sorry about that , I was working on the Teco O&M costs .
<en=52>Thanks
<en=53>Ben
<en=54>Please send me an excel spreadsheet which depicts the value that you see associated with the heat rate spread option .
<en=55>I want to make sure that I understand exactly how you propose valuing the transaction and how this value would be booked .
<en=56>As such , please provide the following detail :
<en=57>Will we be valuing / booking a series of monthly call options or a series of daily call options ?
<en=58>What power curve are we valuing the deal against - PJM East or West Hub ?
<en=59>Please send me the current fuel curve that you are converting to $ / MWh to value the deal ?
<en=60>What volatilities are you using to value the options - monthly volatilities or intra-day volatilities or a blend of the two ( if blending please show me what formula you using to blend the two vols ) ?
<en=61>What expiration date are you using , i.e. : for monthly call options the 15th of the relevant month , and for daily options ?
<en=62>What correlation are you assuming , 15 % flat for twenty years ?
<en=63>Are you deducting all operating expenses from the value of the option ?
<en=64>Are you using the " SPRDOPT " Exotic Options function to value the option ?
<en=65>Are you using the $ / MWh VOM dollar amount as your strike ?
<en=66>Has Don provided the fixed payment stream ?
<en=67>This stream should be covering both P&I and not just principal .
<en=68>Yvan , and Ben , please provide answers to these question via written correspondence so that their is limited probability of misunderstanding .
<en=69>Thank you both very much for your time and help thus far .
<en=70>Furthermore , I would like to reiterate that RAC 's goal , prior to quoting any credit reserve , is to be 100 % confident that : ( i ) the methodology that is being employed is consistent among the internal groups ; and ( ii ) the inherent value of the price risk management contracts matches .
<en=71>This enables RAC to manage the associated risk during the life of the transaction both effectively and appropriately .
<en=72>Regards ,
<en=73>Christopher
