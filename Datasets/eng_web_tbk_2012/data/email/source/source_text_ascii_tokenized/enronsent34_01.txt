<en=1>Susan , Joe ,
<en=2>The referenced TAGG # was entered as a ' New Counterparty ' , can you please let me know what counterparty this is so we can correctly assess the counterparty exposure .
<en=3>Thank you ,
<en=4>Russell
<en=5>Hey there yourself ,
<en=6>Sorry I have n't written you guys in a while to keep you properly updated .
<en=7>I am indeed checking on flights to Seoul and do n't think I 'm going to go at exactly the same time as my parents .
<en=8>As much fun as they are , I figured we would probably do some different things than what you have planned for them .
<en=9>As for Ted , things are still going well although I have n't see him at all this week ( we are two very busy people ) .
<en=10>But , we had a great laid back day last Saturday and I think have hit that comfortable stage ... you know , not quite so formal about dates etc .
<en=11>In one sense it 's great , but it also makes things a lot harder to read .
<en=12>Anyway , I 'm sure my Mom told you guys but Travis and Kathy got to meet him and I think it went well .
<en=13>Hopefully , if we 're still dating come December , you and Chuck can meet him when you come back to visit .
<en=14>I 'm planning on dragging him to at least one of the U.T. games , I just have to find out when he wants to go ( as well as properly prepare him for the Scott / Kelley / Parks / Wild Card gang and the full - day affair that is a U.T. game ) .
<en=15>Things in Houston are good and definitely warm .
<en=16>I went with Emily and her Mom last night to see the musical " Rent " and it was wonderful .
<en=17>Also , I 'm going out to San Diego for the Labor Day weekend to visit Hoot 's daughter Julie .
<en=18>Needless to say I am very excited .
<en=19>Talk to you guys soon ,
<en=20>Susan
<en=21>Hey girlie ,
<en=22>How are you doing ?
<en=23>Have n't heard from you in a while .
<en=24>A little birdie told me that you were checking into tickets for Seoul .
<en=25>Are you really ?
<en=26>Would you come with your parents or separately ?
<en=27>In any case , we have had some more time to do some exploring ( and shopping ) , so we have some good ideas about what to do if you come .
<en=28>I think that we will stay in Korea when your parents come and do the whole base thing ( which will take only a few minutes , actually ) , but are considering going to China or somewhere during part of Thanksgiving .
<en=29>We 'll do whatever you want want if you still are coming !
<en=30>Let us know the latest with Ted and also with what 's going on in Houston .
<en=31>Take care ,
<en=32>Chris

<en=37>Hey Tonto ( a.k.a - the trusty , but silent , side - kick to the Lone Ranger or in this case the Big D )
<en=38>The play was very good and I think well received .
<en=39>I 'd forgotten how blown away I was by some of the songs the first time I saw it in NY .
<en=40>The cast members really have to have incredibly powerful voices to pull off a few of the most poignant numbers ( I think this could be your true calling ) .
<en=41>I caught the third day of Corey 's Jeopardy run last night here at the office ( yes , I had to come back after the play ... I love my job ! ) .
<en=42>Anyway , I 'm sure I 'd mentioned it before but yes she is a very smart girl .
<en=43>As a result of that , she has managed on several occasions over the years to detract from my enjoyment of playing Trivial Pursuit or watching Jeopardy by absolutely obliterating me ( The girl actually did her senior thesis on Trivia ) .
<en=44>Kori told me she saw you last night at Steak Night and introduced herself since I failed to do so the last time we went .
<en=45>I should let you know though that she was very offended this morning that you did n't spell her name right in the email - I mean it 's such a common spelling .
<en=46>So was Darren there last night to meet her or do you just think they 'd make a good match ?
<en=47>She 's a very fun girl .
<en=48>Hope you day is going well and that the move to 30 went off without a hitch .
<en=49>Good luck with all of the " fun " meetings .
<en=50>Shorty
<en=51>-- Due to the lack of response yesterday , I 'm beginning to worry about your success with the road test ...
<en=52>I 'm going to assume that you did n't get around to it .

<en=55>How was the play ?
<en=56>I forgot to tell you that I saw your friend on a re-run Jeopardy the other night and I almost called you but it came on at 11:30 .
<en=57>Smart girl .
<en=58>I ran into Corey last night at LW s and I am thinking this is a girl for Darren .
<en=59>Anyway , lots of fun meetings today .
<en=60>I 'll talk to you later .
<en=61>Maybe you should ignore the sentiment of the quote I sent earlier ...
<en=62>I think you may be adhering to it too faithfully .
<en=63>At this rate we may have to start pinning notes to your shirt to remind you to do things .
<en=64>However , having driven with you on several occasions I feel confident you will be able to pass the test with flying colors .
<en=65>Keep in mind though that if you end up failing I will not let you forget it ( and , as we have established , I have the memory of an elephant ) .
<en=66>I 'll keep discussion of me to a minimum and just say that things are well on 32 .
<en=67>Now back to what 's really important ... you .
<en=68>Thought you 'd like to know that the Dixie Chicks are coming back to Houston Dec. 12 and will performing just down the street from you at the Compaq Center ... it 's all about you and your needs .

<en=71>AAAAAGGGHHHHHH ...
<en=72>I just found out that I need to take the TX driver s exam both written and on the rode .
<en=73>This is a two day process and all because I let my CA license expire .
<en=74>I know I need some of your organizational skills .
<en=75>I may try to run out and take the test this afternoon while I get moved to 30 ( I better not fail it ) .
<en=76>How 's life on 32 today -- well that 's enough about you let 's talk more about me .
<en=77>There is no pleasure in having nothing to do ; the fun is in having lots to do and not doing it .
