<en=10>Jeff
<en=11>Well , he launched today .

<en=13>I think this is actually a good thing -- makes our proposal look like a much more preferable alternative by comparison , makes our support in the process more important , and sets Harvey up as the Ralph Nader equivalent in the election to fix California 's broken system --- a potential spoiler .
<en=14>Hi .
<en=15>Well , would n't you know it .
<en=16>I 'm not driving tonite , but I bet that we could hitch a ride back with Anil .
<en=17>I 'm not sure , but I think that he 's got class tonite , too .
