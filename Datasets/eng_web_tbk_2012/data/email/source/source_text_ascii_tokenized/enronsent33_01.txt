<en=3>It 's a two way street , of course .
<en=4>Have they expressed any interest in negotiating ?
<en=5>There is nothing wrong with a REAL negotiation , but nothing particularly helpful about generating one that s just for show .
<en=6>Particularly in the absence of any entreaty from them .
<en=7>Where is the " simple " explanation of the transportation piece ?
<en=8>As I have told RNR , I think we should advise Duke in writing that its IP is not in conformity with the contract , since it is in the alternative , and that our IP is hence the only one that will be before the arbitrators ( since Duke clearly can not change it's ineffective IP at this stage , having already seen ours ) .
<en=9>Accordingly , the only issue left for arbitration is whether our IP ( the only one and therefore the one they have to choose ) is or is not an economic hardship under the contract .
<en=10>What say ye ?
<en=11>none

<en=29>Richard ,
<en=30>How does this look ?

<en=34>In the three years I have been here , I am unaware of an ENA / ECT bad faith claim against any insurance company .
<en=35>Anyone else ?
<en=36>If so , please contact Michelle .
<en=37>Michelle Blaine@ENRON_DEVELOPMENT
<en=38>11/28/2000 07:35 PM
<en=39>Justin , I have no knowledge of any bad faith actins Enron has pending in Texas but I will call Richard Sanders who manages domestic litgation here .
<en=40>I 've read the materials you sent and agree we need to address these allegations appropriately .
<en=41>Richard do you have any bad faith litigation pending against any insurers in Texas or are you aware of any Enron has filed ??
<en=42>We sued Houston Casualty last year but I do n't recall making any bad faith claims .
<en=43>It settled anyway , a long time ago .
<en=44>mb
<en=45>Michelle ,
<en=46>Did you get my fax on Friday ?
<en=47>I guess the questions on which I should like your steer are : ( a ) Do you have a particular sensitivity about the reference to bad faith proceedings made by United India ?
<en=48>( b ) Is it right that Enron has 3 sets of bad faith proceedings in Texas ?
<en=49>( c ) Are you happy with the draft letter to Beachcrofts I sent you ?
<en=50>Please give me a call if you would like to discuss .
<en=51>Justin
<en=52>Not when I was there , but I was n't there the whole time .
<en=53>Michelle and Ken ,
<en=54>were you able to discuss the " bad faith " proceedings issue yesterday ?
<en=55>If you got the chance today , I should be really grateful if one of you could give me a call to discuss this issue ; I think we should set out DPC 's position clearly on this in correspondence without too much delay .
<en=56>Justin

<en=129>Dear Mr. Sanders -
<en=130>?
<en=131>While I left a you a phone message with some information about our project , I thought I could give you some additional details by e-mail as well ...
<en=132>?
<en=133>We are still very interested in having Enron support our eCommerce Dispute Management Protocol .?
<en=134>We have had enthusiastic responses from companies such as AT&T , Duke Energy , Pitney Bowes and Daimler Chrysler , and I would be pleased to answer any questions you may have about this focal point for our educational efforts .?
<en=135>The real purpose of my call , however , is related to the services we will provide to support the aspirational statements of the Protocol .
<en=136>I am a member of the design group that has been developing the American Arbitration Association 's dispute management systems and services for eCommerce B2B transactions .?
<en=137>At this time we are putting together small working groups to validate some of our assumptions and refine our initial service offerings .
<en=138>Initially our design group , along with perhaps one of our technology consultants , would like to meet with a group of Enron people for half a day .?
<en=139>Ideally this group would consist of four to six people from finance , legal , and operations so that we get good cross-functional feedback about our services .?
<en=140>Before the meeting we would provide you with a brief description of our proposed service offerings and a list of points for discussion at the meeting .
<en=141>The real focus of the meeting will be on how we should build these services to meet the needs of businesses operating in B2B marketplaces .?
<en=142>We are very concerned with providing services that are relevant to that environment .
<en=143>We would like to meet between November 14 and ? December 1 ? since construction of our services is already underway .?
<en=144>Please let me know what is possible , and feel free to give me a call if you have any questions ( 978-376-9004 ) .
<en=145>?
<en=146>Thanks .
