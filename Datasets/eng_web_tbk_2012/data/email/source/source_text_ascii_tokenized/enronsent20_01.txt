<en=3>Steve , I noticed that our allocation from 2000 to 2001 is going up by 21 % year on year ( ie ) $ 13.9 M from $ 11.5 M .
<en=4>We have been able to keep ENA 's direct group expenses flat year on year , we are trying hard to keep the corporate allocation flat year to year as well .
<en=5>Do you have a view on how we might be able to achieve this goal ?
<en=6>Regards
<en=7>Delainey
<en=8>Do n't worry about it ... sorry for putting you back on speaker .
<en=9>I just wanted Sue to hear ( she enjoys utility bashing so much ) .
<en=10>Thanks for the comment on the hearing .
<en=11>In some respects I do n't think the first panel could have gone much better ; everyone thanked FERC for intervening ( though for different reasons ) .
<en=12>The other staff reports are also looking good .
<en=13>Scott Miller has been a godsend -- somebody not afraid to tell it like it is .

<en=17>I apologize if I offended anyone .
<en=18>Please let them know that I was simply quoting the CEO of a large , regulated utility in California .
<en=19>Thanks for attributing the quote to me .
<en=20>You did a great job at the hearing ---- it went decidely downhill after you left .
<en=21>Best ,
<en=22>Jeff
<en=23>Does she have any interest in meeting one - on - one or is she just looking for a public hanging ?
<en=24>I remain convinced that if we can just get the facts in front of people they will modulate their approach .

<en=28>Given the short notice , we will politely decline to participate at the hearing on Monday , but will let the good Senator know that , in general , we intend to engage actively in the process and plan to help California find a solution that works for everybody .
<en=29>Amen .
<en=30>See below .
<en=31>Can we get some help on the IBM issues ?

<en=34>Steve :
<en=35>At this point , our IT contacts are backpedalling a bit and suggesting they can overcome the TIBCO and Terminal Server problems .
<en=36>There are still four important issues , however :
<en=37>IT still can not commit to transferring messages across domains .
<en=38>This means that messages initiated at Corp and intended for the entire Enron organization will not reach any business units outside the Corp domain .
<en=39>No messages will reach the EES organization unless IBM agrees not to use their proprietary message delivery tool , WebSphere , and will use WebLogic instead .
<en=40>WebLogic is required by BackWeb , although it is designed by a separate company .
<en=41>HR , intended to be a key user of this tool , will not use BackWeb because survey responses can not be made anonymous .
<en=42>HR has already purchased a tool called CONFIRMIT that can execute anonymous surveys .
<en=43>Messages will not be delivered simultaneously to all users in the same domain , nor will they be delivered for two to five hours after they are sent by the message administrator .
<en=44>Another thing to consider is that these messages will be set to expire and disappear within a set period of time , meaning users can not retrieve them and read them later ( as they can with e-mail ) .
<en=45>This means that I could be away from the office for several days and miss a message entirely , because it would have expired and disappeared by the time I returned .
<en=46>The plain fact is that a few members of IT are pushing this initiative , but they lack commercial sponsorship .
<en=47>They are hoping Corp will foot the bill for a pilot which will allow them to fully test this tool before implementing it company - wide .
<en=48>Please let us know if you have additional questions .

<en=52>Do we have a sense for how many we can reach , how many we ca n't and where they are ?
<en=53>Are whole offices ( eg Tokyo ) unreachable or is it only those who have home offices ?

<en=56>Mark and Steve -
<en=57>Erin Rice and I would like to meet with you to discuss the issues concerning BackWeb before we proceed .
<en=58>As you can see from the Design Document , they are pretty significant .
<en=59>Thanks ,
