<en=5>Dear All ,
<en=6>My mane is Visit Phunnarungsi .
<en=7>I used to e-mail Vince Kaminski about the advice on his article " The Challenge of Pricing and Risk Managing Electricity Derivatives " and he had mailed me the copy .
<en=8>I am now modelling the Queensland electricity spot price using Geometric Brownian Mean Reverting Jump Diffusion Model and have followed your paper " Making the most of mean reversion " to estimate the mean reversion speed .
<en=9>I use Queensland half - hourly price during 13 December , 1998 - 30 June 2001 giving about 44,000 price observations .
<en=10>However , the result from Ordinary Least Squares was not as expected due to different sign for both slope & intercept .
<en=11>The coefficient and standard error are as followed :
<en=12>Intercept : - 0.3931 ( 0.0076 )
<en=13>Slope : 0.1171 ( 0.0022 )
<en=14>R Square : 0.0585
<en=15>Therefore I could not estimate the mean reversion rate as the estimated slope has the positive sign .
<en=16>I have also tried monthly data and the results are the same .
<en=17>It would be appreciated if you could advice me on this matter .
<en=18>Kindest regards ,

<en=28>Vince -
<en=29>Thanks for the message regarding a possible intern for your group .
<en=30>Right now , we are in the process of evaluating both our new hire needs and our summer needs and will be making those decisions after the first of the year .
<en=31>Until we have come up with those numbers it would be premature to make any offers for the summer .
<en=32>What I would like to do in this case is get the information to Jeff Davis , who is responsible for Georgia Tech and ask him to get Sungjoo 's resume and start a file on him with a notation that you would like to hire him for summer .
<en=33>When we start the summer process , we will interview the candidate and slot him for your group .
<en=34>Is this okay with you ?
<en=35>Hope all is well with you
<en=36>Take Care
<en=37>Traci
<en=38>Traci ,
<en=39>I have visited Georgia Tech on Thursday .
<en=40>One of the students indicated that he is interested in a summer internship .
<en=41>He came across as a very bright person , very personable .
<en=42>I can take him as a summer intern .

<en=44>Dear Dr. Vincent Kaminski ,
<en=45>Hi .
<en=46>How are you doing ?
<en=47>I hope you have a good flight back to home .
<en=48>It was a good opportunity to know about Enron and its finance sector .
<en=49>Thank you for your time .
<en=50>I have already submitted my resume and cover letter right after the talk .
<en=51>However , you ask me to send a copy of resume and cover letter again .
<en=52>Those attachments are what I was asked .
<en=53>Again , it was a good chance for me to get to know what I can do in this field and what I have to more focus on in school .
<en=54>I am looking forward to hearing from you soon and have a nice day .
<en=55>Thank you .
