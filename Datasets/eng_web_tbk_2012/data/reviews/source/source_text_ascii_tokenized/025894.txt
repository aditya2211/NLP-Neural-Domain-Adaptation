<en=1>Average food and deathly slow service
<en=2>I have eaten here several times and every time the service is slower than slow .
<en=3>One time we even left after sitting at the table for 20 minutes and not being greeted with a drink order .
<en=4>Ridiculous .
<en=5>There must be a better mexican place in Rockland .
