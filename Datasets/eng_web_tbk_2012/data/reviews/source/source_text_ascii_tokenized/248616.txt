<en=1>Took a laptop in for a video cable to be replaced .
<en=2>Everything except the display worked fine before I took it in .
<en=3>The video cable was replaced and suddenly the motherboard was dead .
<en=4>Phone calls were n't returned when promised and the botched repair took a week longer than promised .
