<en=1>Quick to take money but not quick to fix a problem !
<en=2>B&B came out very quickly to give us our quote back in June .
<en=3>They were very polite , eager to answer any questions and willing to wait for us to return from vacation to begin installing our fence .
<en=4>Our fence was installed quickly in August and they had their money and left saying " Workmanship is guaranteed for a year ! " .
<en=5>Within a week we noticed one of the boards on our gate splitting where a nail had gone in .
<en=6>We called our representative who assured me he would call the office and have it taken care of .
<en=7>We heard nothing .
<en=8>We then called the office and the man we spoke to said he 'd send someone out to look at it but could n't promise when - two weeks came and went and we heard nothing .
<en=9>I just called again and was told that workmanship , not wood , is guaranteed for a year - well in my opinion - the wood split due to a nail which is part of workmanship !
<en=10>She even went so far as to say " You r calling about one board ? "
<en=11>Well - when you pay over $ 1000 for something you want it to hold up and look good !!!
<en=12>YES !
<en=13>I WAS calling about one board !!
<en=14>I 'm very frustrated at this point - it would take all of 10 min for them to come by and replace the one board that is cracked ( the crack is deep enough to stick a penny in it and it goes clear through ) yet they do not want to take the time to bother with what once WAS a happy customer and has now become a dissatisfied customer .
<en=15>So I figure if they do n't want to take the time to fix the fence that they installed then I 'll take the time to let everyone I can know about how they treat customers once they have your money !!!
<en=16>STAY AWAY !!!
<en=17>YOU GET WHAT YOU PAY FOR !!!
<en=18>They came in under a lot of other quotes and now I know why !!!
<en=19>When the fence was first installed I would have given them five stars , now for their poor customer follow - up and unwillingness to fix the fence they have dropped to a one - star in my opinion !
