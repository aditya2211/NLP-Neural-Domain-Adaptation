<en=1>I have been a patient a NW hospital and it was great .
<en=2>I have also had an 80 yr old that I take of sent to the ER and long stays in the hospital .
<en=3>Yes , we had to wait , but ER is a triage system that takes the most life threatening cases first .
<en=4>Any ER would be the same .
<en=5>As far as being treated like a drug seeker , that has not been my experience .
<en=6>As a nurse I know about drug seekers .
<en=7>This is a great hospital and even better since it became part of the UW system .
