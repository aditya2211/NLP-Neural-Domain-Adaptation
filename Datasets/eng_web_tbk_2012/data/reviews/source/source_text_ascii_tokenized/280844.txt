<en=1>Good Service - Limited Results
<en=2>Andrew was helpful and knowledgeable about acupuncture re : infertility .
<en=3>He was willing to talk to me about my specific issues and develop a plan of action .
<en=4>The office is shared with a foot doctor and it 's very sterile and medical feeling , which I liked .
<en=5>The down side was that sometimes there was a lot of noise in the hallway from other patients / doctors .
<en=6>I worked with Andrew for 2 months and did acupuncture and herbs .
<en=7>The sessions were nice and I felt relaxed after them but did not notice any changes with my cycles .
<en=8>I know it can take a while for results and did n't expect a miracle , but after 2 months I felt like it was not entirely worth the cost / time .
<en=9>( I am also a little suspicious of all these glowing reviews ... )
