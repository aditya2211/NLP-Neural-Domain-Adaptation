<en=1>I guess you get what you pay for .
<en=2>I tried to stay here for a few nights with my girlfriend , so we asked for a single queen bed .
<en=3>We got there , and we were treated to the free " upgrade " of a room with two double beds .
<en=4>Since they consider this an upgrade , they let their other rooms fill up and would not change our room .
<en=5>Then we got put in a room with a huge gap under the door .... right next to the ice machine .
<en=6>We could hear every single thing that happened outside like it was inside our room .
<en=7>When I finally found someone at the desk who could speak English , they moved our room , but we still did not receive the single queen we had " reserved "
