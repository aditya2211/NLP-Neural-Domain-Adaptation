<en=1>Billing Issues ...
<en=2>I had a routine surgery for an ingrown toenail .
<en=3>My insurance company , Blue Cross / Blue Shield paid the fees and everything was fine .
<en=4>Then I got a bill for $ 483.00 .
<en=5>The doctor 's office said that payments had been " reversed " .
<en=6>Blue cross has no record of aa reversal .
<en=7>The office refused my requests to see what they got from BC / BS .
<en=8>They eventually turned it over to a collection agency and now will not even discuss the matter .
<en=9>I eventually decided to just pay the balance even though the doctor has already been paid , but now the collection agency is trying to say another reversal of $ 160.00 has come through .
<en=10>It was an ingrown toenail .
<en=11>How much could it possibly cost ?
<en=12>Not only am I being bilked for money I do not owe , the office staff is rude to boot .
<en=13>I think this office has some serious billing practice issues !
