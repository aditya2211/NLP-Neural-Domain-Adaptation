<en=1>New training Centre is excellent
<en=2>The Award Dance Centre has moved from its Holderness Road site to a new complex on Chamberlain Road Hull .
<en=3>The new Centre has 4 studios planned and now boasts the largest single dance floor area in Kingston upon Hull .
<en=4>The classes cover all age and skill ranges , with BALLROOM , LATIN , SEQUENCE , STREET , DISCO , LINE DANCING , BALLET , TAP & JAZZ .
<en=5>We have attended A Ward Dance Centre for over a year and really enjoy the friendly and welcoming way we are taught Ballroom and Latin as well as the fun filled social dance evening held every Saturday evening ....
<en=6>It is not really possible to score this school too highly , We would give it 12 out of 10 and 5 Stars across the board Steve & Anne
