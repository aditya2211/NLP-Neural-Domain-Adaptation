<en=1>The staff leaves a lot to be desired .
<en=2>The front staff has seen quite a bit of turnover and changed from professional to rude .
<en=3>A simple follow - up phone call with a woman quickly turned into a nightmare .
<en=4>She may be the reason for all the change .
<en=5>I sincerely wonder if the doctor has a clue about what is going on within his practice .
<en=6>If he does know and approves of this behavior then it is a poor reflection on him .
<en=7>Sometimes it is not worth it to go through that kind of staff and their personal attitude to get to a doctor .
<en=8>He was an okay doctor but not worth her .
