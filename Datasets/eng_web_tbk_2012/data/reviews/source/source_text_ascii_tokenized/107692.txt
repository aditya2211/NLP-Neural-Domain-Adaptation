<en=1>Long Lines , Silly Rules , Rude Staff , Ok Food
<en=2>The first thing you notice when you arrive on location is that the waiting line literally goes out the door and spills into the parking lot .
<en=3>A restaurant with this many patrons willing to stand in line just to order tacos must be good , right ?
<en=4>I mean , that 's the way it works at amusement parks : the longest lines are at the best rides .
<en=5>Well , this may be an exception .
<en=6>The staff taking your order and " waiting " on you are very indifferent and have no sense of costumer service at all .
<en=7>I have gotten better results talking to COMCAST customer service than with these folks .
<en=8>And do n't even think about asking to speak to the manager because this guy is , and pardon my French , a jerk .
<en=9>If you have gotten through ordering , dealing with the rude staff and if you followed the dumb rules , you are finally presented with what you came for .. some tacos that are " ok , " but definitely not worth putting up with all the hassle .
<en=10>Save yourself the trouble and skip this place all together .
<en=11>I suggest you go up to Raging Taco & Raging Burrito a couple of blocks up the street or even Taco Mac .
