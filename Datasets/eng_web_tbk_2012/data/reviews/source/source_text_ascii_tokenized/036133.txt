<en=1>Bit sketchy , sporadic delivery times
<en=2>I bought about half of the furniture I own from this place .
<en=3>Why ?
<en=4>Because they cut me good deals if I paid in cash .
<en=5>Sketchy , right ?
<en=6>Well they came through and delivered almost all of my items within a few days .
<en=7>( They even got me a couch pretty quickly . )
<en=8>The guy who was cutting me the deals and getting me the furniture quickly , Ahmed , was nice and mostly professional , except the semi-sketchiness .
<en=9>Then one day , Ahmed left the country , not to return for months , WITHOUT informing me .
<en=10>He also neglected to tell the other person working at the store about a dining room table that I had ordered and that was supposed to be coming in .
<en=11>The other person working at the store did n't know that I still had this table coming .
<en=12>I had paid in cash , and he said he had no receipt / record of my purchase .
<en=13>I came back with the receipt Ahmed had provided upon my purchase , and the guy took forever to copy it but said that he would take care of the situation .
<en=14>I waited .
<en=15>And waited .
<en=16>He never once contacted us .
<en=17>I 've had to pester this new guy several times to ask when my table will arrive .
<en=18>He kept saying different arrival / delivery dates and did n't seem terribly apologetic .
<en=19>It has been 3 weeks and I STILL do n't have my table ( which was NOT cheap , I might add ) .
<en=20>Point is : You might be able to get a good deal on some nice furniture -- which I did -- but they 're not very communicative and god forbid something goes wrong , you 'll have to fight to get it resolved .
