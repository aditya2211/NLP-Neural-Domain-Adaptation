<en=1>It was a Saturday and my spring was broken ...
<en=2>I googled Garage Door Repair in Woodinville and found NDI - Johnette answered the phone and was oh - so pleasant and helpful !
<en=3>She sort of appologized for Dan taking the day off to go skiing - but he could do the repair on Sunday !
<en=4>I said great and Dan arrived on time at 10 am to make the repair .
<en=5>I enjoyed speaking with Dan , and learning more about how the springs are sized for these doors .
<en=6>The repair went quickly and the price was extremely fair .
<en=7>I would highly recommend NDI - and will spread the word to my neighbors .
<en=8>Thanks Dan and Johnette for your responsiveness and professional service .
