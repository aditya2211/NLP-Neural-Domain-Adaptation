<en=1>Lovely Nails on Cayuga St. in Lewiston , NY
<en=2>First let me start out by saying , that I have had very nice pedicures at Lovely Nails on Military Road .
<en=3>I was very excited that a salon was opening in Lewiston , as I live in Youngstown .
<en=4>I was in two weeks ago and had the worst pedicure that I have had in my life .
<en=5>There were four of us and I was taken first by a gentleman .
<en=6>I put my foot in the water and it was cool .
<en=7>He did warm it up .
<en=8>He also hurt my toes will pushing my cuticles back .
<en=9>If the pedicure lasted 20 mins. , that was a stretch .
<en=10>The other ladies had a similar experience , both had nail polish on a couple of toes .
<en=11>None of us will be using their services again , which is a shame .
