<en=1>friendly , fine food
<en=2>The one - star review from 2005 is out of date .
<en=3>There was a change of ownership a couple of years ago and service is both quick and extremely friendly .
<en=4>The food continues to be very good -- deli sandwiches , homemade soups , fresh salads .
<en=5>The atmosphere may not be for everyone .
<en=6>It is a bustling place where separate parties are seated at the same table ( as in many European cafes ) , but if you are OK with that , the food is very good .
<en=7>Love the soups .
