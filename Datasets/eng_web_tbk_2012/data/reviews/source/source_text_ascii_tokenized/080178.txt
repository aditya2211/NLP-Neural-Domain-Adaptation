<en=1>You will be happy at this store !
<en=2>Allen Tire was recommended by friend after my having bad tire experiences in Temecula .
<en=3>The store manager , Jim Smith , made an excellent tire recommendation for my newly acquired Lexus .
<en=4>Tires were the right price and now the car feels like it is riding on rails around turns .
<en=5>The store is clean , run very professionally and a pleasure to be in .
<en=6>They know their job and you do not have to watch them to be sure everything is done right .
