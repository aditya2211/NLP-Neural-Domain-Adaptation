<en=2>Do n't go here unless you want to sit , order , eat and be asked to leave all in a matter of 20 minutes .
<en=3>You wo n't even have time to read the entire menu before being asked to order and if you ask for more time your server will wait at the table .
<en=4>This is the only place I have ever eaten and been told to leave because other people were waiting .
<en=5>I was told to take my coffee to go if I wanted to finish it .
<en=6>Oh , and their liquor license was expired so no Bloody Mary or Mimosas .
