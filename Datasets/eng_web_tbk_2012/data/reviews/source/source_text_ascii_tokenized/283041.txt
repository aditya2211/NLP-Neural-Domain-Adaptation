<en=1>Great Cookies , Cakes , and Customer Service
<en=2>It was my birthday and I had a last minute idea to have a bakery cake instead of one pre-made in a convenience store , but the problem was it was the day before Valentine s and when many bakeries turned me down for a plain vanilla rectangle cake , Fiona stepped up to the plate and was able to make a fantastic beautiful cake .
<en=3>Not only did it taste wonderful , but the texture was unbelievable , the frosting was n't overly sweet to over power the cake , and the cake itself was just amazingly soft , and fluffy , and just perfect overall .
<en=4>Although I 'll have to drive a little out of my way to go there , I 'll gladly do it knowing that since she 's been astounding to me once before that she 'll always be that way !
<en=5>( Also she has a really great website !
<en=6>And we bought a few cookies there too , they were fantastic as well ! )
<en=7>She deserves many 5 star reviews !!
