<en=1>Slowest , Unfriendly Sstaff on Weekends
<en=2>There are three Starbucks locations that I frequent .
<en=3>I have a bit of experience watching the usual assembly line .
<en=4>I also understand that weekend staffs are different than daytime staffs and not necessarily Starbucks A - team or even full - time .
<en=5>But this location has the worst weekend staff I 've seen EVER .
