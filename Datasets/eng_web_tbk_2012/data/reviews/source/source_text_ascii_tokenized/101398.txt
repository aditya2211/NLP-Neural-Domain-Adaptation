<en=1>Disappointed
<en=2>The Bad : I was at Napa recently and was unpleasantly surprised at poor waiter svce and subpar food .
<en=3>We were a party of 4 and none of us were particularly pleased with our dishes .
<en=4>Napa is all about wine but gives very short descriptions of the wines on their lists .
<en=5>I found my initial selection satisfactory but the wine flight we chose to be poorly composed .
<en=6>If you must go ask lots of questions about your selections since your expectations may as high as mine were .
