<en=1>awful awful awful
<en=2>This store is by far the worst Verizon store I 've been in .
<en=3>The salespeople are never available , the lines are always too long , and all the people want is a sale .
<en=4>Incredibly rude and I will not return to it .
<en=5>Is there no other Verizon to go to around Downtown / Dupont Circle 1?!?!?
