<en=1>Instructor never showed up !
<en=2>January 15th -- We were signed up for Saturday 's 2 PM class " Beginning Yoga with Brittany . "
<en=3>We even arrived 10 minutes early as the website suggests .
<en=4>The instructor did not show up !
<en=5>We waited until 2:25 PM and then left .
<en=6>There were 2 in our group , and a 3rd person was also in the parking lot waiting for this class .
<en=7>Well , not much I can say except I 'm very disappointed with this experience .
<en=8>This was our first visit to your studio .
<en=9>In today 's instant world , there 's no reason for the instructor not to even have given us a phone call or e-mail if she was going to be late .
<en=10>As a yoga studio , I 'm sure you 're all aware that all actions generate karma .
<en=11>and sometimes karma can manifest itself on a bad review on Google .
