<en=1>The best in the area !
<en=2>I 've been to quite a few tattoo shops around this area and Stainless Steel is by far the best .
<en=3>I am very pleased with the tattoos that I revived from them .
<en=4>The artwork is excellent and the prices are very reasonable .
<en=5>I would recommend this shop to anyone looking to get a tattoo .
