<en=1>I would n't send my dogs there .
<en=2>I had a conversation with the woman running this place in April 2010 .
<en=3>She basically said if the children getting off the bus are n't paying to enter her building she was going to let them wander around the streets .
<en=4>Wow , really ?
<en=5>With all the child predators out there , a busy road , cars speeding by ...... and you are going to let some 4 / 5 year olds wonder around cause you 're money hungry ?
<en=6>REAL CHRISTIAN OF YOU !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
<en=7>Whether they pay me or not , if their parents get into an accident , stuck in traffic , etc. THE LAST THING I WOULD DO IS LET A CHILD GET RAPED BECAUSE I WAS N'T PAID .
