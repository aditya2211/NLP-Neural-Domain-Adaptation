<en=1>Good food , good wait staff , poor management
<en=2>We visited on 7/26/08 for dinner We received a gift certificate for the Mama Mia 's on Greenfield Ave .
<en=3>The food was good , and so was our waitress .
<en=4>When it came time to pay the bill up front , they would not let me use any of the certificate for a tip ( which I have done with any other restaurant I 've gotten a gift certificate for . )
<en=5>I then asked if I could have money back in cash .
<en=6>The person went to go check with the manager , who was sitting at a table chatting with her friends who were eating there .
<en=7>Her answer was short and manner rather rude .
<en=8>Sorry for interrupting I guess .
<en=9>The cashier was also short , unapologetic and made me feel as I was wasting her time .
<en=10>There were no other options available ( I only brought my check card to cover any overage cost ) and she rang it up and applied it to the gift card before telling me about the tip policy .
<en=11>I will not be visiting Mama Mia 's again .
<en=12>There are other places with food just as good with management that values customers and employees much more .
