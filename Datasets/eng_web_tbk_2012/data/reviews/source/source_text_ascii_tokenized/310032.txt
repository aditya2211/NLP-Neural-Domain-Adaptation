<en=1>Gone downhill since change in ownership
<en=2>Sigh .
<en=3>I used to LOVE this place .
<en=4>But now that they are part of a chain , service has slipped .
<en=5>I am waiting longer at BNA for my pickups and last time I parked with them , they lost my car key .
<en=6>Lucky I had a spare with me !
<en=7>To date they have not made good by either finding the key or paying for a new one .
<en=8>( These new car keys are EXPENSIVE to copy , you ca n't just go to WalMart . )
<en=9>Go to the website for coupons and join the club - you can get free parking .
<en=10>However , with BNA offering one day of free parking due to construction of the new rental car facility , it may be cheaper to park at BNA .
