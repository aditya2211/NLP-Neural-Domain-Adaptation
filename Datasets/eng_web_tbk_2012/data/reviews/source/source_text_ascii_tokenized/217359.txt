<en=1>This insurance co. Is a joke !!!
<en=2>They have absolutely no communication skills whatsoever .
<en=3>if you do n't mind being robbed , cheated or lied to then this is the company for you .
<en=4>They will make every attempt to misinform and misrepresent themselves .
<en=5>They make up excuses in hopes to confuse their policy holders with misinformation .
<en=6>as an example they took payment for 5 out of 6 monthly plan premiums for a yearly policy and cancelled the contract for the remainder of the policy for reasons they stated was not receiving information on other licensed drivers in the household ?
<en=7>I personally provided the request on four separate occasions and they claim there is a glitch in their systems ?
<en=8>Ifa is an acronym for I m a F%#king Assh@%$e !!!
