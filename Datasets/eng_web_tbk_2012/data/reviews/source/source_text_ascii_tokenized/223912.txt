<en=1>The staff do occasionally get game info correct , but if you r looking fot a good game and are n't a nerd , do nt ask them .
<en=2>The last time I did that I was suggested to buy oblivion when I told them I was looking for a fps .
<en=3>I knew what it was and told the guy that it was n't a fps .
<en=4>He tried to tell me it was when I told asked him if he knew what fps stood for and he had no clue .
<en=5>Overall they are n't very knowledge about the type of games are on the market .
