<en=1>My favorite cuban cafe in Orlando
<en=2>I have been eating Cuban for a long time , sandwiches mainly along with other dishes ..
<en=3>I love Cuban coffee , colada ... mmmm anyways I found this place and ca n't stop going there , I stop in at least once a week and anytime I 'm in the area for a Cuban coffee or snack .
<en=4>The place is chill and comfortable .
<en=5>They do n't speak the best English but enough to get by .
<en=6>They bake bread fresh daily , they do n't press their sandwiches which is the way I like it , and the meat is always fresh .
<en=7>They have a great lunch special with your choice of meat , chicken , steak , or pork and rice and black beans and fried plantains .
<en=8>And their breakfast is awesome !!
<en=9>I can not describe how delicious the mango and cheese pastries and the omelets are to die for .
<en=10>Stop in and have a bite you wo n't regret it .
<en=11>A slice of heaven in winter park off forsyth !
