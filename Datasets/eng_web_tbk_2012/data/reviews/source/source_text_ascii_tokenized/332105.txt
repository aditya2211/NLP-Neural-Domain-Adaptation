<en=1>My wife and I avoided doing some fairly simple electrical re-wiring in our home for several years due to overall hassle and cost involved .
<en=2>I finally called Matt from Bonafide and he made the project both easy for us and reasonable .
<en=3>He was prompt , knowledgable , friendly , clean and just an overall great guy who obviously cares about his business .
<en=4>I will reccommend his services however / whenever possible !
