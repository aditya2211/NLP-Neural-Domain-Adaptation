<en=1>Trust The Midas Touch
<en=2>I personally trust this Midas store with all my vehicles , I have been going there for years & would never go anywhere else !
<en=3>the staff is very personable & actually care about the customers safety rather than taking there money .
<en=4>This is however a very busy shop but there are appointments available & the staff up front will surely make sure you get back in a timely manner .
<en=5>I look at some of these other comments & laugh because people think that the world revolves around them !
<en=6>Like the girl with the fuse problem ...
<en=7>Midas has the most high tech equipment in town & I guarantee you if they told you it was electrical then in deed it s electrical !
<en=8>maybe you should understand how the world works & realize you are just like any other person & not put yourself on a pedestal .
<en=9>I will continue going to Dave at Midas because he is one of the most honest business owners in this town !
<en=10>When having your car worked on you have to trust the mechanic & this Midas is truly someone you can trust !
