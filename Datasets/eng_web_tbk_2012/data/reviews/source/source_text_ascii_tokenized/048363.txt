<en=1>Excellent Driving School
<en=2>I was involved in a car accident 20 years ago and since then I 've been a nervous wreck and have n't been behind the wheel .
<en=3>Unfortunately , a family emergency required me to conquer this fear .
<en=4>A very good friend of mine highly recommended the Professional Driving School and I was told to specifically ask for Gerry .
<en=5>She highly recommended him and described him as the " Saintly Instructor and Simply the Best Instructor there is .... very calm , pleasant and very detailed in giving instructions " .
<en=6>I called the school most probably 10 times before I finally enrolled in a 20 hour package .
<en=7>I had to cancel my initial lesson 4 times and on the 5th attempt the management was quick enough to associate my cancellations with my fear and finally encouraged me into taking my initial lesson .
<en=8>Five minutes before my initial lesson , I got a call from Gerry advising me of his arrival and to come down as soon as I was ready .
<en=9>My heart pounded as I walked down and pounded even faster upon seeing Gerry in an SUV - Lexus !
<en=10>I thought of canceling the lesson once again because I did n't feel comfortable driving an SUV .
<en=11>Gerry pleasantly said " since I am already here why do n't we give it shot .
<en=12>I trust you and believe that you 'll be able to handle this and all you have to do is to reciprocate !
<en=13>Trust me and most especially trust and believe in yourself .
<en=14>Do n't worry , I 'll take care of you ! "
<en=15>....... the rest was history !
<en=16>Here I am now driving confidently on my own .
<en=17>Gerry , I ca n't thank you enough for helping me cope with my fear .
<en=18>To my friend , thank you for your recommendation ... you were true to your words in saying Gerry is a " Saintly Instructor ... Absolutely Simple the Best Instructor and Best Driving school there is !
