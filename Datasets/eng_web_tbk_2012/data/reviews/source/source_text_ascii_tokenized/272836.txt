<en=1>So Handy for Local La Jolla Stuff - Especially for Finding Residential Numbers
<en=2>Since moving back from college and trying to settle roots in the Village , I have referred to the La Jolla Blue Book for a ton of local numbers .
<en=3>The white pages allowed me to get in touch with parents of my high school friends so that I could track people down one by one and the restaurant section is basically my cookbook .
<en=4>It 's really cool that so many local businesses are found so quickly in one place and I want to spread the word .
<en=5>THX :-)
