<en=1>Great , Honest Service
<en=2>I took my 2001 Nissan Frontier in to fix a cracked manifold .
<en=3>The dealer wanted $ 1300 to fix that and another $ 1500 to fix some other things .
<en=4>Eagle Transmission determined that much of the work the dealer said needed to be done was unneccesary and what needed to be fixed was only $ 400 !!
<en=5>I was so impressed with the honesty and integrity of Mike and everyone at Eagle Transmission !
<en=6>I dropped the truck off in the morning and it was ready that afternoon .
<en=7>I have finally found a mechanic I trust !!
<en=8>And it was great that they did not charge a service fee to diagnose the problem - an added bonus !!
