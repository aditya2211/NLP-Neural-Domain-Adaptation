<en=1>highly recommended .
<en=2>I have been going to Warner Family for a number of years and would highly recommend it to anyone .
<en=3>I 've read some of the reviews below and would like to state that yes , like any other doctor s office there is sometimes a wait ( depending on what other patients are being seen for ) and some of the tests and procedures that are ran can be costly ( just like they would be for any other medical tests elsewhere if you do not have insurance ) ...
<en=4>I have seen several of the providers from the office and have not once been shown anything but care and consideration .
<en=5>I ca nt speak for them but any tests or appointments they recommend are probably in the best interests of us ( the patient ) and you have the ability to decline anything that they suggest to you .
<en=6>I personally have had wonderful service and if you re truely looking for a FAMILY practice ... Warner Family is the place for you .
