<en=1>First and Last time we 'll eat there
<en=2>My friend and I went there for lunch today .
<en=3>Neither one of us had ever been - so we thought we 'd try it .
<en=4>BIG MISTAKE - The food was tasteless and cold .
<en=5>We both kept trying to find something we liked .
<en=6>The only thing I found edible were the potato wedges , I finally gave up , he kept trying - he found the fried wantons to be OK - His Mongolian bowl was awful .
<en=7>Would NOT recommend this place to anyone - in fact - save your money and go somewhere else .
