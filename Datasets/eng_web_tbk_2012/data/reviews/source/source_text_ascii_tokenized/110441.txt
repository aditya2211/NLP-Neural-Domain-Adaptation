<en=1>Favorite place in Tampa .
<en=2>Update : I had to add to my review .
<en=3>I was just in last night and had a chance to dine in their new dining room .
<en=4>AMAZING !
<en=5>I frequent this resturant on a weekly basis but usally only for lunch .
<en=6>Well I was in for a treat when I was greeted by the friendly girls at the counter who asked if my wife and I would like to sit in their " new " dining room .
<en=7>Right away they told us that it was the same great food with the same prices so off we went .
<en=8>We were greeted again and sat promptly .
<en=9>After looking at the menu and seeing the new menu items they had , we knew we were in for a treat !
<en=10>I had the Chicken Parmesan Dinner and my wife had the Shrimp Scampi Dinner .
<en=11>AMAZING !
<en=12>The portions were generous enough that we even took some home !
<en=13>I have to say the value of this place always amazes me .
<en=14>It 's nice to see that even in the economy we can eat a place that has upscale service , amazing atmosphere , and Incredible food , but not break the bank while enjoying it !
<en=15>Bottom line is that when it 's a small privatly owned resturant like this is you can tell that the owners and employees take pride in their product and service .
<en=16>Well Done !
