<en=1>Horrible .
<en=2>Horrible .
<en=3>When we walked in , the person behind desk said : " oh well , you must wait , I am in the middle of something . "
<en=4>After a good few minutes , he asked : " what do you want ? "
<en=5>Somewhere in between his rudeness he asked if we smoked .
<en=6>I asked if this hotel had smoking rooms .
<en=7>He immediately said " no , there is a $ 50 deposit now ! "
<en=8>Sure enough he charged it to the credit card .
<en=9>When I inquired he rudely replied " in the morning when things are checked out you 'll get it back . "
<en=10>I called customer service about it because the website specifically states that there are no other charges at the check - in .
<en=11>I also mentioned to the reception person .
<en=12>He responded " we have problem with ' people ' " .
<en=13>Imagine a hotel having problems with people .
<en=14>I finally alerted him to his rudeness .
<en=15>He said he 's had a long and bad day .
<en=16>We had no choice but to stay but will take this as far as we can .
<en=17>Do n't stay there .
<en=18>I came to find out the person was the hotel OWNER also .
