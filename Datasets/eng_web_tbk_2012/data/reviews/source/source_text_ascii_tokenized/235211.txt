<en=1>Lovely People , Great Hats
<en=2>I was saddened to see the reviews that claimed World Hats Mart has poor service .
<en=3>It led me to believe that the reviewers simply had difficulty tolerating people with strongly - accented English .
<en=4>The husband and wife who run this spot are lovely people .
<en=5>We have had many conversations with them and they have always been extremely patient with me as I tried on multiple hats in search of the right costumes for my magic act .
<en=6>I recommend them highly !
