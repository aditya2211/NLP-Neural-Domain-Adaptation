<en=1>We were expecting a great experience , when we recieved a friendly greeting by the hosts .
<en=2>The atmosphere was nice and very clean .
<en=3>The menu had plenty of options even for picky eaters .
<en=4>The service was ok , our waitress kept forgetting our drinks even though we reminded her several times .
<en=5>To start we tried the guacamole and salsa verde , it was completly flavorless .
<en=6>We should have left then .
<en=7>We orderd our meals anyway , chimichangas , jalapeno borritos , and quesadillas .
<en=8>Everything was bland , completely void of any spice or flavor .
<en=9>We have never had mexican food this bad , it was just simply gross .
<en=10>Hopefully they spice things up or they wo nt be in business long .
<en=11>I recommend La Hacienda
