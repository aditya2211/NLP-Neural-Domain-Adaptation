<en=1>a great vacation !
<en=2>We wanted to see the sun - and we also got much more !
<en=3>Excellent chefs are in the kitchen preparing memorable breakfasts .
<en=4>After a train ride over the mountains , we enjoyed hiking in the flower - filled Wenatchee hills ( in May ) and a very interesting bike ride in a loop around the Columbia River ... and then wine if we wanted it on the patio in the evening ....
<en=5>This is a busy group of hosts they are also running a restaurant , which also must be wonderful - so just ask for what you need , and I 'm sure they will do their best to be hospitable .
