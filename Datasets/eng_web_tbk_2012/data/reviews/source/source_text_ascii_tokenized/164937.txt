<en=1>Super nice people , really good food
<en=2>What I love most about this place , other than the food , is that eating here makes you feel like you 're in a small town rather than Baltimore .
<en=3>The owners are really nice , they serve good food at a good price , and the option to eat outside on the deck ( esp on the weekend whether there is hardly any traffic ) is great .
<en=4>One of my top 5 places to eat in Baltimore .
