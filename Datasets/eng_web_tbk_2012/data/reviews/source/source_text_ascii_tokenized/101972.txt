<en=1>Poor service
<en=2>If you like the drama described in popular sitcom ' Seinfeld ' , you will see it here .
<en=3>We signed our name in about 6:00 pm .
<en=4>There were 3 names before us .
<en=5>The greeter said there was about 15 minutes waiting .
<en=6>However , we waited and waited and in the mean time , saw 4 groups of people simply just paraded in without signing there names .
<en=7>This sign in policy is posted by the restaurant " no reservation , sign your name here " .
<en=8>I had to ask the greeter , he explained his reasons with broken English .
<en=9>I could not understand any his reasons .
<en=10>I could only take it as they would seat the people they know first .
<en=11>My conclusion is that you should only go there if you want to wait a least an hour and see all kinds other people being seated before you .
