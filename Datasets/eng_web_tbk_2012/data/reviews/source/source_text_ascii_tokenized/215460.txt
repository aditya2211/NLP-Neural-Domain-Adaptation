<en=1>Beware of Sharayu
<en=2>Hopless service , at the time of booking my car a lot was promised but delivered not even one tenth of what was promised .
<en=3>Apart from that in spite of my repeated attempts I could not get in touch with the manager to even lodge an official complaint .
<en=4>My advise to all is I have fallen into this trap ... pl ensure you do nt !!!
