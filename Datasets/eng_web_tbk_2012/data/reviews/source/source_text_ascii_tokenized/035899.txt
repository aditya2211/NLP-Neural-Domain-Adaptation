<en=1>Highly Recommended
<en=2>We walked in to pick our little man at 10 minutes to closing and heard laughter from kids and the staff .
<en=3>The facilities are more than adequate and the staff are just phenomenal .
<en=4>Their sense of humour and calmness when dealing with the little ones amazes me every time I walk in .
<en=5>We have since moved slightly further away from the centre but it 's worth the extra travel , as the care provided exceeds our expectations ... especially after a few horrendous daycare experiences elsewhere .
