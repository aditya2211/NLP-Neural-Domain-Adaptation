<en=1>Very Accomodating
<en=2>We were in Springfield , IL for a family funeral from Kansas City .
<en=3>We arrived early and the staff was very accomodating to our families and the situation we were in .
<en=4>The rooms were very clean , including the microwave and refrigerator .
<en=5>This is a nice place , and I know we will return to meet my sister - in - law from Chicago !!
