<en=1>Best Store In Boothbay Harbor
<en=2>What a fantastic store , I love this place .
<en=3>Not the same old stuff that all the other stores have .
<en=4>Their items are very unique , great quality , great prices .
<en=5>They also have the best tea I ever had , not at all like the junk you get at the grocery stores , I stock up when ever there because they are closed in the winter .
