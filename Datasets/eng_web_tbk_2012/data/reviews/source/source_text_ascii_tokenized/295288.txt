<en=1>Just Autos Thank you !
<en=2>Was fast and easy , Just had our car returned this morning , I would recommend these Mobile Mechanics for sure .
<en=3>They certainly know what they are doing .
<en=4>The mechanic came to our place and sorted out our car s problems , he explained the problem and was very up front and honest , it was towed to the workshop as the gearbox was not working ( he explained it better ) .
<en=5>They phoned the same day , confirmed it was the gearbox quoted me the job , I gave the go ahead .
<en=6>Now my car s gears and brakes have never run so well ... ever it s like driving a new car .
<en=7>So yes , I would n't hesitate in recommending the team at Just Autos for easy professional car repairs , Thank you Just Autos for your help .
