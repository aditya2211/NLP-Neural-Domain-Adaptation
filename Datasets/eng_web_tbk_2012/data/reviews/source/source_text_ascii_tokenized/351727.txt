<en=1>Overpriced
<en=2>This place is identical to the Youngstown Sports Grille , so I imagine they are owned / operated by the same people .
<en=3>The food is mediocre at best , and largely overpriced given the portion size and quality .
<en=4>Do n't even get me started on how expensive it is to drink there .
<en=5>I have ate here 3 times since they first opened , and the service has been poor each time , the staff always comes across as somewhat rude and slow .
