<en=1>Liars , negative stars !
<en=2>Took my Cruze in twice for poor fuel economy .
<en=3>The first time they claimed to get reasonable mpg .
<en=4>However , they would never drive the car with me in it to prove their findings .
<en=5>I wonder if they were going down a hill !
<en=6>They told me to bring it back after 5000 miles .
<en=7>I brought it back with 9000 miles .
<en=8>They " finished " the work and told me the car was ready .
<en=9>I found out they did not even drive the car , stated they looked at it before .
<en=10>They still would not drive the car with me to show their mpg number .
<en=11>They also claimed not to see anything wrong with the blower fan ( a seperate issue ) , but when I drove the car home I had the same symptoms .
<en=12>I will never purchace another vehicle from Vic Canever .
