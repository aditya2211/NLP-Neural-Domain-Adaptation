<en=1>What you can learn from the below ' bad experience ' .
<en=2>I would suggest not avoiding Second Home based on the ' bad experience ' review .
<en=3>I 'd probably be more inclined to board my two dogs here , seeing that they do n't just take every dog coming in .
<en=4>I 've toured this place and was impressed by how clean the place was , and all the options for the dogs .
<en=5>It 's unfortunate that bmil believed that his ' perfect ' dog was not given the right opportunity to prove himself .
<en=6>But I 've done hundreds of dog introductions myself ( another place , I do n't work here ) , and owners can have unrealistic expectations and views of what they see when their dogs meet other dogs .
<en=7>Workers who do these introductions look at the interaction objectively ; and it 's good to see they are able and willing to say no if they feel there would be a problem .
<en=8>It sounds ( according to your own statement ) that they had a roomful of dogs , so they must be doing something right - and are keeping those dogs safe from potential problems .
<en=9>You say you work a lot , and that you have a young dog ; so I have little doubt that your dog is just filled with energy to burn ; and it is good of you to look for a place to take him .
<en=10>But not at a risk to other people 's pets .
<en=11>You were clearly given another alternative by Second Home , to board him - which might have given your dog a chance to come and go from Second Home a couple times , getting used to the place and maybe facilitating another attempt to get into daycare later .
<en=12>No business is going to push customers away without good reason ; so is n't it reasonable to think they might know what they 're doing ?
<en=13>My dogs are far from perfect , and one of them I believe would be a little much for daycare here herself ( at least initially ) .
<en=14>Be a little more reasonable with your expectations of a place like this ; and maybe do n't jump to personal attacks suggesting that they do n't want to work hard , just because you bruised your own ego .
