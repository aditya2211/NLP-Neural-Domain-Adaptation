<en=1>Mezza Luna FTW !
<en=2>their mezza luna's are deffly better than the pizza rolls .
<en=3>it s like a pizza roll , but they just toss ham and cheese inside .
<en=4>it seems like it s healthier too , but it s prolly not .
<en=5>also , you can call em ahead of time , and then go to pick up ur food , or have it delivered ** .
<en=6>that cuts down on teh wait time , cus u can do other stuff while u r waiting .
<en=7>it usually takes 20 mins for a mezza luna , as they have to add pure delicious extract to the mix .
<en=8>their pizza was a little salty for me , but it s still good .
<en=9>they do that whole thing where you sandwich the pepperoni between layers of cheese for + 32 delicious .
<en=10>anyways , the mezza luna : you should try it .
<en=11>it runs you about 4 bucks and it deals crushing blows to hunger .
<en=12>** Edit : Living on campus at Clarkson University , I have had food delivered before .
<en=13>This was back between '05 and '09 and I do n't remember how many times we 've had it delivered .
<en=14>Perhaps they do n't deliver anymore , but the deliciousness of a mezza luna certainly warrants a pickup .
