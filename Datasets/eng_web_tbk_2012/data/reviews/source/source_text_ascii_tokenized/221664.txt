<en=1>This place is a Rip - Off
<en=2>I brought a car in to have the " check engine " light diagnosed back in March of 2010 .
<en=3>They said it was " plugs and wires " and quoted me $ 330 to do the work , including parts .
<en=4>I asked why so high and they said it was due to the labor of moving things out of the way .
<en=5>Those things ended up being a windsheild washer fluid tank ( 1 screw ) and the air filter canister ( 4 spring clips ) .
<en=6>I did the work myself for $ 50 .
<en=7>There 's no excuse for that kind of estimate .
