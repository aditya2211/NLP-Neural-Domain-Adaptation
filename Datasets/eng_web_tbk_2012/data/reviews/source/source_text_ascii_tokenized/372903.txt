<en=1>Fantastic for kids
<en=2>If you have children or are just a real animal lover yourself you 'll love this zoo .
<en=3>It 's only $ 10 and in essence just one big petting zoo .
<en=4>They sell feed and milk bottles at the front and I recommend you buy lots .
<en=5>We took our 7 month old and she laughed and giggled when ( very harshly I might add ) grabbing and ' kissed ' the goats and lambs .
<en=6>The animals were all very sweet and patient with her .
<en=7>Among the animals that were available to touch were pony's , camels and EVEN AN OSTRICH !!!
<en=8>Wonderful , inexpensive and lots of fun !
