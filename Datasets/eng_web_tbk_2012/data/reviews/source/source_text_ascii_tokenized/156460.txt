<en=1>Unbelievably huge experience for such a small salon !!!
<en=2>I have been to Kim at Cheveux for more than five years .
<en=3>I can not tell you how often I am complimented on my hair ( style AND color ) !
<en=4>I regularly request Kim 's business cards as I am often stopped on the street and asked " Who does your hair ... I LOVE it !!! "
<en=5>Quaint , lovely , small salon with BIG personality .
<en=6>I am made to feel special when I am in the chair and I have NEVER had a less than amazing cut or color experience .
<en=7>My hair has never felt this healthy , either .
<en=8>I can not recommend this salon enough !!!
<en=9>Thanks Cheveux !
