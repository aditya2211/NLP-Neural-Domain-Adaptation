<en=1>Identity Theft
<en=2>Myself and my fiance 's identity was stolen from the office staff .
<en=3>We were told by a detective and asked to check our credit for anything unusual .
<en=4>Luckily they caught the crooks before they did one on us .
<en=5>It was a black female that use to work in the office .
<en=6>She stole the information and gave it to another guy that did all the work .
<en=7>The other guy was pulled over one day and a cop saw suspicious papers with names and social security numbers on it .
<en=8>That s how they were caught .
<en=9>They both went to jail and a new manager was put in charge of the apartments .
<en=10>The apartment across from mine belonged to a gang of hookers .
<en=11>Nobody lived there .
<en=12>A girl would show up , then a guy in a nice car would show up .
<en=13>Short time later the guy would leave , then the girl .
<en=14>My apartment was usually quiet .
<en=15>I lived in one that did not face the parking lot .
<en=16>Parking spaces are just big enough for a Mini Cooper .
<en=17>It sucked having an SUV .
<en=18>If I found a spot , I could nt fit in it .
<en=19>Gates worked 30 % of the time at best .
<en=20>Bugs were a small problem , nothing too bad .
