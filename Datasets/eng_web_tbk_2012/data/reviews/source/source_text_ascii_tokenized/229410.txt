<en=1>The Worst Experience Ever !!!
<en=2>I have worked with Ted Jurek at Decor and You , and it started out as a decent experience .
<en=3>He was referred to me by a friend , who did n't have the best experience with Ted , but said that Ted was able to make up for his lack of preparedness at the end .
<en=4>I figure I would give this company a chance .
<en=5>However , after giving a required $ 500.00 ( NON REFUNDABLE ) deposit before seeing any plans or ideas , I was sorry I did .
<en=6>We met a couple of weeks later , Ted was late .
<en=7>He brought fabric books , and pictures of furniture only , which all came way over budget .
<en=8>By the time we got to the budget i told him I could work with , there was basically no design .
<en=9>Just curtains and a couple of accessories .
<en=10>WHAT IS THAT ?????
<en=11>This company is way too expensive with nothing to show for it .
<en=12>Please everyone .... take heed and do n't get caught up in the hype about DECOR and YOU working with every budget ...
<en=13>This is just a way for them to squirm their way into your precious pocket
