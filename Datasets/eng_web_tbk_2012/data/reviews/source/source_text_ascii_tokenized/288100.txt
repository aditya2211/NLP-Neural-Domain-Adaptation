<en=1>Poor Service , Lack of Passion : Do NOT go
<en=2>I began seeing Dr. Romanick back in 2000 and have seen a significant decline in the quality of care , patient - doctor communication , and just the overall level of services .
<en=3>The poor quality starts at the receptionist desk , where the staff is very impatient and lack the efficiency I once loved about the office .
<en=4>It took them nearly two months to complete a simple task , and countless calls from my part due to their lack of response and passion ( not that it 's a requirement for the job , but it helps to at least pretend to be helpful ) .
<en=5>Also , I was promised to have my test results emailed to me , but it never happened , and after a few attempts to get Dr. Romanick on the phone to brief me on my condition , I finally gave up and went to a different doctor .
<en=6>Please do not go there if it 's professional , friendly , diligent medical services you 're looking for .
<en=7>Save yourself the trouble , money and time and visit a more caring facility / doctor .
