<en=1>Bait and switch , untrained workers
<en=2>Called the Bonanza store 2 weeks ago , before I ripped out 350 sq ft of ceramic tile ... was told I would need a " dual head concrete grinder " to remove thinset and make a nice " finished " look ( ready for concrete stain ) .
<en=3>Was quoted $ 55 all inclusive of grinder inserts , etc .
<en=4>No problem , sounded like it 's done every day .
<en=5>Will look beautiful .
<en=6>Got the tile ripped out , call today , now all the sudden this grinder wo n't leave a finished look AND it 's $ 125 PLUS around $ 75 for the inserts .
<en=7>I can rent another machine for like $ 60 that will give it a finished look .
<en=8>So from $ 55 to $ 260 ?
<en=9>Are they serious ?
<en=10>I feel like they did n't tell me the pitfalls before I pulled out this tile and now that I have no other options they want 5 TIMES the price ?
<en=11>Either these people do n't know anything about what they are renting , or worse - they are bait and switching .
