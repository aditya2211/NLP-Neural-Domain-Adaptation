<en=1>HORRIBLE !!!! !
<en=2>This has to be some of the worst pizza I have ever had the misfortune of ordering .
<en=3>The crust was lopsided , thicker on one side than the other .
<en=4>It actually had a hole in one of the slices .
<en=5>There was minimal cheese and sauce and it completely lacked flavor .
<en=6>I know New York pizza and this is not it !!
<en=7>This was nothing like New York style pizza !!!.
<en=8>I love pizza and this was a complete and utter disappointment !!
<en=9>I would not suggest this pizza to anyone !!!
