<en=1>Was there this past weekend and the guy behind the counter yelled at me and my son because we believed he left the grandma slice in the oven a little too long and the cheese got all dried out and the slice tasted more like a cracker .
<en=2>He preceded to grab the slice off the countertop and throw it into the trash while yelling at me saying , " you do not order what you do not know about " and " you do n't know how pizza is made " .
<en=3>It was very upsetting to see this kind of behavior especially in front of my four year old .
<en=4>He was in the process of making me a pie and when I got home , the pie was the worst I have ever seen .
<en=5>Cheese was falling off , so oily and greasy .
<en=6>I think he did it on purpose because of my simple request for another slice of grandma that was n't so well - done ( actually , burnt ) .
<en=7>I will never go back to this place and I am reporting them to the better business bureau for such horrible customer relations and basically sabotaging my pizza and taking my $ 25 .
<en=8>THIS STORY IS 100 % TRUE .
<en=9>That little man who thinks he invented pizza can kiss my *ss .
