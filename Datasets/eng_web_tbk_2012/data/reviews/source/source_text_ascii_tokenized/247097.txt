<en=1>Food Craving Gone and Weight Loss at Acupuncture Doctor
<en=2>I am a college student .
<en=3>Before treatment , my food cravings were " out of control " which caused me to be stressed out .
<en=4>I experienced a Definite Decrease in food craving ( about 50 % ) and decrease in stress after the 1st treatment .
<en=5>I actually loss 4 pounds after my 1st treatment and 2 pounds after my 2nd treatment .
<en=6>I was amazed .
<en=7>I am now more at peace and my food craving is about 99 % gone after only 3 treatments .
<en=8>Before coming to Acupuncture DOCTOR I was a big baby about needles and only came because my boyfriend 's aunt recommended it .
<en=9>It hurt very little , felt more like pressure than pain .
<en=10>What I like most about Dr. Liau is that she is very caring .
<en=11>She talks to you at each appointment .
<en=12>I can tell she really cares and wants to help .
<en=13>I am SO GLAD to have found Dr. Liau .
<en=14>Now I feel more confident wearing my bathing suit in the summer .
