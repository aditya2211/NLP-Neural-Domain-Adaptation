<en=1>Craft Wonderland with History
<en=2>My first visit was so fun yesterday .
<en=3>I could have stayed all day and not seen all the things .
<en=4>I am doing origami jewelry and found exactly the right things for earrings and got many other ideas there too .
<en=5>I bought a beginner s quilling set and like making the filigree forms you can make and add to other crafts .
<en=6>The owner , Jean , has been there 31 years !
<en=7>What a history .
<en=8>She is a super sweet , lovable and well - informed woman with a great sense of humor .
<en=9>I really enjoyed meeting her and happy to learn she comes from Oklahoma and has the values of a solid no bs country girl .
<en=10>This store is a real gem and has much to offer the serious crafter or the occasional crafter .
<en=11>By the way , Salmagundi ( the store name ) means something like smorgasbord ; potpourri ; motley ; variety ; mixed bag ; miscellaneous assortment ; mixture , a variety of many kinds of things .
<en=12>Great name for a great store !
<en=13>Shop Local !
