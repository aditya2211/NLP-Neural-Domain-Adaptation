<en=1>Excellent service and quality
<en=2>I had Hom - Excel replace most of the windows in my Tampa residence three years ago .
<en=3>The excellent windows have performed without any problems , but that 's not why I 'm writing my review .
<en=4>Three weeks ago , burglars tried to gain entry into the rear of my home .
<en=5>The intruders slit the screen of the window .
<en=6>Next , they tried to force the window with a pry bar and then to break the window with a hammer .
<en=7>The window did n't break !
<en=8>My next - door neighbor heard the noise and turned on a light , thankfully scaring the two miscreants away ( they even left their hammer behind ! ) .
<en=9>I called Home - Excel the next day to order a replacement screen for the window , and was happily surprised when they said that they were n't even going to charge me for the replacement screen ... that it would be covered under their guarentee .
<en=10>Lo and behold , they replaced the screen ( which had to be ordered ) yesterday and did n't charge me a dime .
<en=11>Their worker even cleaned 3 of my windows and changed a lightbulb for me .
<en=12>In this day and age , it is so rare to find a company with such nice workers and such far ranging guarantee policies .
<en=13>I rarely write reviews such as this one , but they certainly deserve anyone 's business !
