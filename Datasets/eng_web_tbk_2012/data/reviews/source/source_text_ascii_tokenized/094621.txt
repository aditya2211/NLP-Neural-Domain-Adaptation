<en=1>Disatisfied customer , I went through Kitchen Aid and used one of their recommended vendors .
<en=2>A&E came out , charged $ 129 fee just to walk in the door .
<en=3>I needed a part for my appliance , the cost was very high so I said never mind , paid the fee and called a local business for a second quote .
<en=4>The second vendor charged $ 55 ( less than half of what A&E charges ) to come and applied that to the price of the repair service ( which A&E does not ) .
<en=5>Their quote came in at half the price of A&E for the same work and same part .
<en=6>Seems to me like A&E charges way more than necessary !
<en=7>Very disappointed in Kitchen Aid as well , I thought that they pre-screened their vendors for price and quality of work , obviously they do not !
