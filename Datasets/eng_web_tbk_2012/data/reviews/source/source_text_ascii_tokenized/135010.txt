<en=1>The New Italian Kid on the Block
<en=2>Another Italian restaurant in Collingswood ?
<en=3>Do we need another one ?
<en=4>Only if it is of the quality of That 's Amore .
<en=5>The menu has the usual but then they step it up another notch .
<en=6>The arancini di riso ( risotto fritters ) are not to be missed .
<en=7>Chicken saltimboca was excellent and then there 's the chocolate mousse that comes straight from heaven .
<en=8>Pay extra attention to the appetizers - the next time I go there I 'm planning on ordered a few instead of an entree .
