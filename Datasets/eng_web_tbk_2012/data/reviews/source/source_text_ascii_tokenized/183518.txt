<en=1>An Asset to Richmond
<en=2>For a long time , one big source of entertainment missing from the Richmond City Limits was a first - run multiplex .
<en=3>Bowtie has filled that role nicely .
<en=4>The theatre is in an old brick warehouse , which is a block away from the Flying Squirrels stadium .
<en=5>The owners of Bowtie manged to add something new while preserving what was already there .
<en=6>The theatre has greatly improved the surrounding neighborhood .
<en=7>There 's plenty of parking , and I 've never had an issue with audience members who wo n't stop talking or answering their cellphones .
<en=8>Best of all , there are no ads !!!! !
<en=9>Just previews and the main feature .
<en=10>Expect to pay full price , and the theatres themselves are on the small side .
<en=11>But if you like going to the movies , you should love Bowtie .
<en=12>The mangers also play a classic movies on Sundays , you can get a beer in the lobby , and repeat customers can get discounts if they have a member card .
<en=13>A great cinema in a great location .
<en=14>Thank you , Bowtie !
