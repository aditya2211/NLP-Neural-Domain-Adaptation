<en=1>Our company is a high end designer handbag and fashion accessories company , thus we are certainly a niche market .
<en=2>We had been evaluating SEO providers for quite some time and finally decided to take the plunge with Stuart , and Ulistic .
<en=3>We made the decision for a couple of reasons .
<en=4>1 . Social Media .
<en=5>We were familiar with Search Engine Optimization strategies , but new nothing about Social Media - we just heard that it was the next big thing .
<en=6>2 . We really liked the fact that Stuart sets defined objectives and we meet once a month to go over our Key Performance Indicators .
<en=7>How has it gone so far ?
<en=8>Well we have been working with Ulistic for 1.5 months , and have 100 people following our site on Facebook , and our web site , www.designofashion.com has seen a 3 fold increase in traffic , which is significantly beating our expectations - SEO is a process that takes time and to get results this quickly is exceptional .
<en=9>We are absolutely confident that Stuart 's ethical and focused strategies will see these trends continue to grow , and our business will reap the rewards of this program .
<en=10>Finally , it must be said that Stuart is a fantastic person to work with , because of his solid strategies and equally as importantly because he is a genuinely good person and a great communicator .
