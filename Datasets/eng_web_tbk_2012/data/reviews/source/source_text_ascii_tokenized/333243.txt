<en=1>Very unhappy ...
<en=2>Working with Rod Jacobsen was my first experience working with a CPA , so I did not know what to expect .
<en=3>That said - he seemed to be doing well enough .
<en=4>However , then I asked to amend my return to apply a credit I had just become eligible for .
<en=5>I expected to pay for this service , but imagine my surprise when I received a bill for MORE than what I paid to have the original return prepared .
<en=6>Asked why , Rod simply told me that he had to research how to do the amendment ( it was an amended to show that I had purchased a home - nothing out of the ordinary , one would think ) and that took time to figure out .
<en=7>Well , that was strike one .
<en=8>I was n't going to use them again , but I was going to leave it at that .
<en=9>However , now that I have come to realize that I am going to owe the IRS $ 6,000 + despite doing exactly what Rod told me to do , I feel I have to voice my opinion .
<en=10>Last year , after all was said and done , I asked Rod whether my payment structure would leave me with no / little tax liability at the end of the year .
<en=11>He said yes .
<en=12>Well , again , I am now faced with a tax bill of $ 6,000 + , all due on April 15 , 2010 and all that Rod has to say to the matter is ' well , you wo n't have to pay a penalty . '
<en=13>I may not have to pay a penalty , yet , but this is NOT what I had in mind when hired these guys .
<en=14>In the words of my new accountant , THEY LET ME DOWN !
