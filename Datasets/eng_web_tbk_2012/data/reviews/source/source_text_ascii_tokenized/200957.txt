<en=1>Horrible
<en=2>I have been growing my hair out for 1 year plus and went in to get 1 inch taken off .
<en=3>I walked out with 5 inch long hair on the top , 2 inch long hair on the sides , and 1.5 in the back .
<en=4>My hair is uneven and it looks rediculous .
<en=5>This woman should be working in supercuts ... if that .
<en=6>This was a terrible experience and I hope that no one else goes through that .
<en=7>Do your self a favor and do not go to this establishment .
