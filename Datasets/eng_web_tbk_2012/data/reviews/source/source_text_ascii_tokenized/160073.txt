<en=1>Review on House of Joy Chinese Restaurant
<en=2>My family and I moved to San Antonio a year ago and have tried almost all of the Chinese Restaurants because we love Chinese food .
<en=3>Well it took us a while to find one that we liked .
<en=4>But we do n't just like House of Joy WE LOVE IT .
<en=5>Everything we have gotten there has been more authentic and better tasting than any other Chinese restaurant in the San Antonio area we have been to -- and trust me we have been to a lot of them .
<en=6>We just happen to stumble across this little restaurant one day when we had to visit the Bexar County Tax Office off of Bandera Road .
<en=7>We stopped in and got some take out and can not stop going back .
<en=8>They have the best Egg Drop Soup I have ever tasted .
<en=9>We also love their Egg Rolls and Spring Rolls .
<en=10>And every entree we have ordered is perfect .
<en=11>Everything is always cooked fresh and tastes fresh .
<en=12>Their prices are extremely reasonable for the amount of food you receive .
<en=13>The staff is also just so pleasant to deal with .
<en=14>They are also quick at getting your order out to you .
<en=15>You do n't have to sit and wait around forever like most places !!
<en=16>So anyone looking for an Excellent night out for Chinese or maybe just lunch should stop in and try it because I promise you 2 things --- You wo n't regret it !!
<en=17>and you will go back for more !!!

<en=19>PS I have noticed on here that someone left a comment that " all of the nice comments must come from co workers or friends " and I will tell you that I do n't know these people except from eating at their restaurant .
<en=20>We are from Virginia and just moved here a year ago .
<en=21>So that comment is completely false .
<en=22>Because we think IT 'S THE BEST !!!
<en=23>and we do n't know them except for eating there .
