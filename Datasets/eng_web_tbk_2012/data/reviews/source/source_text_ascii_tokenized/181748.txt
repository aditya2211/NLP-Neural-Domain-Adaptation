<en=1>Be Careful Of Who Your Sales Guy Is
<en=2>I think this place is probably really great especially judging by the reviews on here .
<en=3>My experience was awful though .
<en=4>It ALL had to do with the sales guy which was a young 22 year old who had admittedly only been working for 2 weeks .
<en=5>I was extremely interested in the car and very likely would have bought it , but the sales guy I dealt with ruined the deal .
<en=6>Essentially , I told him I did n't trust him cause he was a car salesman , but he got so incredibly offended at that statement that he had to go cry to another salesman and compose himself before coming back .
<en=7>I do n't know if the kid had a bad day or what , but I had to sit and apologize about nothing for 10 minutes until he dropped the issue .
<en=8>After that , I just tried to ignore his lack of professionalism and test drive the car .
<en=9>I played dumb and asked him questions that I already knew the answers to and he responded with half truths and a few falsehoods .
<en=10>For instance I asked who owned Mazda and he said with confidence that was GM , which is n't true .
<en=11>I mean , I do n't care if he does n't know , but if he pretends to know and tells me BS to my face , there 's no way I 'm going to trust him when matters turn to the price of the car and financing .
