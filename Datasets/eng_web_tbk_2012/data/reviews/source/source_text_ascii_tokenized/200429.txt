<en=1>Horrible Service !
<en=2>I got yelled at , literally yelled at because i asked if i could pick up my car 5 - 10 minutes late .
<en=3>I explained that i was already on my way and i would rush to get there as soon as i could because i needed my car for work at 5 am , but the guy was arguing with me saying he was gon na lock the doors right at 5:30 .
<en=4>Rude , unprofessional , just jerks .
<en=5>Seems like all they care about is the money and getting home on time , NO care for the customers AT ALL !!!
<en=6>Missed a whole day of work because i am now carless .
<en=7>I will NEEEEEEEEEVERRRR go to this place again .
