<en=1>Dr. Shady
<en=2>Kelly hit the nail on the head .
<en=3>" Dr. Shady " is a jerk .
<en=4>After the way she spoke to me on my last visit , I will not be returning !!
<en=5>Good luck keeping business with that stuck up attitude Dr. Shady .
<en=6>You have just lost mine .
<en=7>The next time you feel like being condescending to someone , it is not going to be me !!!!!!
<en=8>Dr. Shady is inexperienced and prideful .
<en=9>She probably does not even have 10 % of the knowledge that some of the other EXPERIENCED vets do in this area .
<en=10>I will be carefully researching vets before I take my dog someplace else .
<en=11>Beautifully written reviews Doctor , but completely UNTRUE .
