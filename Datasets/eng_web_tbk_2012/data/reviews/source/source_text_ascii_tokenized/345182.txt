<en=1>Do not use this company !
<en=2>I dropped off a sheet metal piece that I needed copied due to th it was needing to be replaced .
<en=3>I asked if they could copy the piece I dropped off .
<en=4>They said it would be made exactly like the one I needed to replace .
<en=5>I picked it up when it was finished and was charge 30.00 .
<en=6>When I got to the job and tried to insert the new piece of metal IT WOULD NOT FIT !!
<en=7>I took the original piece of metal and rigged it to make due since I had to complete the job .
<en=8>I took the receipt and the metal that did not fit and asked Pomper for my money back .
<en=9>The girl at the desk was sooo rude I could not believe it !
<en=10>She told me she could not use the piece I was returning and the company would only put it in the trash so I could not return it .
<en=11>I explained I did not get what I paid for .
<en=12>She asked me to bring the original piece back and I told her I had to use it on the job .
<en=13>She told me that was to bad she would do nothing to help me since she could not use or resell the piece .
<en=14>I said I was going to trash it also and could I at least have a credit .
<en=15>With a smirk on her face she told me NO MONEY IS BEING RETURNED and THAT IS THE WAY IT WAS .
<en=16>DO NOT USE THIS COMPANY .
<en=17>There are to many people that need our business to have to put up with this unfair treatment !!!!!
