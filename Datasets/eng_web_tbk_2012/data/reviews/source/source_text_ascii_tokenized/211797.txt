<en=1>MUST READ - Do not waste your time in this store .
<en=2>At my appointment the girl helping me was unable to adequately lace up some of the dresses .
<en=3>They felt like they were going to fall off of me and it was very difficult to see what I would actually look like were I to purchase some of these dresses .
<en=4>I thought it would be a good idea to see how a few that I liked would look like on a model ( by looking the dress up online ) .
<en=5>So , as I was leaving I asked for the designer / dress name or style number associated with my top picks .
<en=6>They said they were " unable to tell me until they ordered my dress " .
<en=7>Hmmm ... A person can not call a company , if you have no idea its name ( since the designer is unknown ... SUPPOSEDLY ) , and order a gown without a dress name or style number .
<en=8>Do other brides fall for this ???
<en=9>They either : a ) do n't want to give it to me because they do n't want me purchasing the dress elsewhere or b ) are recreating the dresses themselves ( ie STEALING other designers ' dress designs and " filling the orders " by their own seamstresses ) .
<en=10>I 'm no detective but ... uhh ... seriously ?!?
<en=11>Whatever type of operation they are running , I 'm not interested and if you 're smart , you wo n't be either .
<en=12>What a waste of TIME .
<en=13>Aside from that little * mystery * , one of the sales ladies was quite comfortable telling me how wrong I was about how another dress that I loved compared to one of her dresses that I was trying on .
<en=14>Somehow , since she supposedly does n't know any names of designers / dresses , after I told her the designer and dress name of the one I was comparing , she knew " exactly which dress " I was referring to and disagreed with my observation ; she said that the bodice did come as low as the one I had on .
<en=15>My point : Even if I was wrong , do n't sit there and argue with the customer .
<en=16>Say something like , " Huh .
<en=17>I did n't think so but you could be right . "
<en=18>Unless you want to take the " tell the customer how wrong she is and try and force her into a dress she 's obviously not loving " approach which will likely get you ... uh ... nowhere .
<en=19>Seriously : do not waste your time .
<en=20>Other shops around this city have MUCH NICER and more TRANSPARENT owners .
<en=21>Not owners that seem like they have something to hide and know nothing about common courtesy and customer service .
<en=22>I felt very much like Wedding Gallery was being dishonest and I would n't trust them to lace me up in another gown let alone trust them with the gown I will wear on the most important day of my life .
