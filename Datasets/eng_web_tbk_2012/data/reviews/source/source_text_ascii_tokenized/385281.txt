<en=1>Great first experience .
<en=2>I 'm 22 , and my hairdresser was great ( and not " old " like one of the reviews says ) - she really listened to what I wanted and gave me tons of tips on how to style my hair so I could get it to look the way I wanted it to .
<en=3>She deep conditioned my hair and took the time to style it properly .
<en=4>She recommended products but absolutely did n't pressure me to buy .
<en=5>It 's a cute place with a really friendly , laid - back atmosphere .
<en=6>I would highly recommend it and will be going back for my next haircut .
<en=7>Oh !
<en=8>And students get $ 5 off , ca n't argue with that .
