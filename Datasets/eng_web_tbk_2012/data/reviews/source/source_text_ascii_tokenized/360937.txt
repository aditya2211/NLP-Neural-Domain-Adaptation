<en=1>I stopped in today @ Yards Brewery .
<en=2>I must say , I was impressed with the size of the bar area and lounge , & I liked that you could see the brewery right thru the glass !
<en=3>I had a sampler of IPA , Brawler , Love Stout & ESA .
<en=4>All were awesome , & I had a Dogwood Grilled Cheese which was enjoyable with the fine beers .
<en=5>After my sampler & sandwich , I asked for a pint of there Nitrogen Love Stout , I must say I was impressed , with the great taste & I am a Guiness Lover so coming from me , I think this is better , it s less dry & smoother !
<en=6>If you are in Philly you have to come check this place out !
<en=7>The only negative I have abou this place is the parking !
<en=8>I left with a case of BRAWLER !!!! !
