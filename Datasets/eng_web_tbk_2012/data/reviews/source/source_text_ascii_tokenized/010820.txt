<en=1>The moving company is actualy based in Brooklyn , but advertised all over NY / NJ , including Fort Lee .
<en=2>When the guys arrived ( 2 hours later than agreed ) they told that you have to pay all the tolls they payed coming from Brooklyn and extra $ 100 for them to drive back from your destination .
<en=3>That was not in agreement eather , but they realy demand it .
<en=4>And another $ 100 for wrapping the furniture .
<en=5>So totalling $ 212 just for start before any work started .
<en=6>Guess what , was not in the initial agreement as well .
<en=7>I was moving out from 2 bdr apartment and it took for 3 strong guys 6 hours to load a track ( from 2 pm - 8 pm ) .
<en=8>The only reason I 'm giving 3 stars instead of 1 or 2 , I should admit , nothing was broken .
<en=9>So I still can recomend them but prepare pay twice as much as they tell you initially .
<en=10>One more thing , they do n't take any credit cards or checks .
<en=11>You have to pay CASH ONLY before they start unloading track on your destination .
