<en=1>Highly Recommend
<en=2>I work as a Transformational Life Coach .
<en=3>Since this is an alternative therapy I always refer clients to a lisenced therapist when I feel that is appropriate .
<en=4>I found her through a colleague one day when one of my clients was in the midst of a panic attack and needed professional help that I am not qualified to provide .
<en=5>Little did I know that I would soon be needing her help as well !
<en=6>She guided me through a very difficult period dealing with a family member 's suicide , coupled with elder abuse .
<en=7>I found her to be extremely solid , kind , compassionate , and intuitive as well .
<en=8>I would recommend her highly !
