<en=1>Wonderful service for large group
<en=2>I had my wedding luncheon at this BJ s restaurant , and it was one of the best choices that I made .
<en=3>It was a great deal -- we paid a certain amount per person , and my husband and I chose 4 types of pizza and the servers brought out as much as we wanted .
<en=4>We were also served salad and soda .
<en=5>We had a large party , about fifty people or so , and yet everything was served quickly and we all had a wonderful time .
<en=6>Even though we were only supposed to have those specific types of pizza , when guests asked for a different type , it was brought out with no charge to us !
<en=7>I really appreciate BJ s for making that special day even better with their wonderful food and service .
