<en=1>Terrible service !!!
<en=2>Made an appointment to have them come to the house to discuss curtain options and give an estimate .
<en=3>They sent over someone who said he knows nothing about curtains and could not show me fabric options or give an estimate .
<en=4>When I called the manager to complain , she said she KNEW the guy did n't know about curtains and that the usual lady called in sick hours earlier !
<en=5>Instead of rescheduling they chose to waste my time instead .
<en=6>So what was the point of the appointment !?!
<en=7>To just come over and hang out ?!?
<en=8>I will NEVER do business with this company !
<en=9>EVER !!!
