<en=1>The finest Christmas Trees i 've ever seen .
<en=2>I felt like I was in heaven when I walked through the majestic fields of this particular farm .
<en=3>The trees were in magnificent shape and the variety was astounding .
<en=4>The owners were entertaining and gracious .
<en=5>I especially liked the Eco friendly atmosphere and the owner s love of all animals .
<en=6>This is one of the best farms I have ever been too .
<en=7>I would call it the Taj Mahal of the east coast !
<en=8>It put hair on my chest and thanks to the owner s advice I invested vanguard , got myself a woman like Jerry , and became a republican .
<en=9>Thanks Tussey Mountain Tree Plantation !
