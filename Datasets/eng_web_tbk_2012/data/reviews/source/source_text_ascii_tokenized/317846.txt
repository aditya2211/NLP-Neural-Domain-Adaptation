<en=1>Great Sanwiches , Great Prices
<en=2>I used to go here almost every day since I work in the neighbourhood and loved their turkey and meatball sandwiches .
<en=3>Chicken salad salad is great too .
<en=4>Best of all , the staff is quick on their feet and even with long lines , usually serve you in 5 minutes or less .
<en=5>For the quality , the prices ( $ 4 - $ 6 ) have to be the best in town .
<en=6>The staff get to know regulars and do their job very well .
<en=7>Tourists like the other reviewer might not appreciate their efficiency or quality , but I certainly do .
<en=8>This is n't a TGIF or Cafe , it s a lunch sandwich place and a good one at that .
