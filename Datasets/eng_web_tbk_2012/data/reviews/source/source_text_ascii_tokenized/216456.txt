<en=1>My friend and I were to stay here for a girls night , catch up on our lives evening .
<en=2>We live within 20 miles of the hotel and wanted to get away from our responsibilities for the night .
<en=3>Unfortunalty my husband and I had to put our 13 year old lab down that morning and we were not expecting this .
<en=4>My friend called the hotel to cancel our room as soon as I called her .
<en=5>They said that we were to be charged for this room regardless because we did not cancel within the 72 hours .
<en=6>I called them back a few hours after putting my Bodhi down and they still would n't budge .
<en=7>Times are hard , I know , but they had no compassion .
<en=8>I called 3 times to talked to a manager , never a call back .
<en=9>I emailed 4 times , never a response .
<en=10>In one of the emails I attached the letter from the Vet 's that expressed their sympathy , this hotel did nothing .
<en=11>I even emailed Mackinaw Tourist and nothing .
<en=12>I am sure this is a good place to stay from reading the other reviews , but if something unexpected happens in your life , they will not care .
