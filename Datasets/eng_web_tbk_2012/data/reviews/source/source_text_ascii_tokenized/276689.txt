<en=1>The landlord is not nice nor helpful
<en=2>I have lived in Buckingham Condominiums townhouse for 2 years .
<en=3>I love the location and the apartment !!
<en=4>I 'm a single female and I feel safe coming home at night .
<en=5>The maintenance people are AWESOME !!!!
<en=6>And the exterminator is very nice , also .
<en=7>Yes , you still have a few bugs , but that 's going to be anywhere you go !
<en=8>The only problem that I have experienced is the landlord .
<en=9>She is a pure b**** !!!
<en=10>I know that 's ugly ... but she wo n't help you out for anything ... sad story .
<en=11>Other than that , I would recommend living here . :)
