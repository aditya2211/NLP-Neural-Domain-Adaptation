<en=1>Exile is the best !!!
<en=2>Exile is the longest lasting and most authentic punk store in Richmond !
<en=3>I have been shopping there for over six years now .
<en=4>The staff is incredibly friendly and helpful and the owner , Mimmy , is an absolute angel .
<en=5>The mark up is minimal considering that the clothing is hard to find and often shipped for Europe .
<en=6>In addition , the clothing is of much better quality than the clothing from hot topic , which is made as cheaply as possible by people living in horrible conditions in Asia .
<en=7>Exile is environmentally conscious and involved heavily in our community .
<en=8>Shop local at Exile !!
