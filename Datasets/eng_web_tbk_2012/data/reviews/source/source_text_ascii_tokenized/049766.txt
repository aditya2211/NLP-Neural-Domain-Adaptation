<en=1>WWW - Wonderful Wild Wildernest inn
<en=2>I would give the Wildernest inn ten stars of five !
<en=3>Atop Spring Mountain , from the decks of the West porch , " one can see forever " a scene of unparalleled beauty and grandeur .
<en=4>I saw deer frequently , in fact a small herd were grazing near the lodge .
<en=5>There were occasional bears on the deck in the morning .
<en=6>and most correctly , us visitors did not mingle with the native wildlife .
<en=7>It would have been more than one could bear !
<en=8>Kathy and Stewart , the proprietors were the epitome of perfection .
<en=9>Delightful , hospitable , superb , cozy and comfortable .
<en=10>I hope to be back !
