<en=1>Best Salsa ( hehehe )
<en=2>After my trees were cleaned up , they gave me a jar of salsa .
<en=3>The owner warned me that it was the best salsa I would ever had , and he was right .
<en=4>No joke !
<en=5>I hate to say check them out just for the salsa , but James , I NEED another jar badly :) All kidding aside , they are a very good company , I have a hard time giving any service biz a 5 star review but they came close .
<en=6>Very affordable ( do n't call it cheap ) and their trimmers were quick and courteous when I got home from work .
<en=7>And the salsa , be sure to ask for a jar and have plenty of chips around , you will need them .....
