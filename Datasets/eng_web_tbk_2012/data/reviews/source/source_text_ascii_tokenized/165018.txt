<en=1>Run for the hills ... you 'll be much better off !
<en=2>One night was too much .
<en=3>First room had used tissues next to the bed and I requested it be rectified .
<en=4>I was then moved to another room around the back where the room was dirty , the shower was dirty with other people s hair in it , the toilet seat was peeling and rough and the bathroom was full of mould .
<en=5>I called reception to ask if they knew the state the room was in and was told " This is a Days Inn , not the Hilton " and the receptionist then hung up on me .
<en=6>To warn you to stay away from this place just is n't enough .
<en=7>There was not one ounce of caring involved and anyone I can warn about the complete lack of service will be warned .
