<en=1>Best DJ's In Town !
<en=2>Wow !
<en=3>These guys were the best .
<en=4>They were thorough , high class , and went above and beyond .
<en=5>We never had to worry about a thing , and they led the way the whole time .
<en=6>They asked us things that we would have never have thought of , and took extra time to meet with us when we needed it before the wedding .
<en=7>Having a team was the best because they kept the flow of the wedding going the whole time !
<en=8>They may look young but do n't let that fool you , as their knowledge of music far surpassed what we expected .
<en=9>I am a music junkie that grew up in the 80's , and my dad worked for a record label in the 1960's .
<en=10>So we did n't expect them to even know some of the requests that we asked that night .
<en=11>They just really know their stuff !
