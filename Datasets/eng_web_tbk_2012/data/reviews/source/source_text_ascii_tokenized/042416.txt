<en=1>Ca n't wait to go back !!!
<en=2>This is by far the BEST B&B that we have ever stayed at !
<en=3>We were in Santa Fe for a special event and our hosts rented out the El Paradero for all their guests to stay at .
<en=4>We could not have been more welcomed , more comfortable or more well fed .
<en=5>The weekend was perfect in every way , in large part to Sue and her great staff .
<en=6>Everyone was so friendly and really went out of their way to make sure everything went well .
<en=7>We can not wait to go back to Santa Fe and to this great B&B ... especially my 4 year old , who made friends with Ms. Sue and all the ladies , and has talked about them since we left !
<en=8>We would highly recommend the El Paradero on your next trip to Santa Fe !
