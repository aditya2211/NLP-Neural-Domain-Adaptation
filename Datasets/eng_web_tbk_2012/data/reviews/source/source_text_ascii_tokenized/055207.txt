<en=1>Spay and neuter service .
<en=2>I have no doubt that the rescue is wonderful .
<en=3>But I had my cat spayed through their reduced / free spay and neuter program and the vet they sent us to was first of all a hour and a half away , and 4 days later we had to bring them to our normal vet because the vets at the place in wisconsin did a crappy job and they got infections .
<en=4>My vet even said it was not my fault it was the vet that did the surgery , So I would not recommend getting that program unless you have an extra hundred dollars or so for antibiotics and a vet visit .
<en=5>You 'd think they would do a good job but they do n't care unless they are getting paid full price .
<en=6>Which is so dumb .
<en=7>Not to mention the fact that they gave us our cats back not even 30 minutes after they were out from surgery .
