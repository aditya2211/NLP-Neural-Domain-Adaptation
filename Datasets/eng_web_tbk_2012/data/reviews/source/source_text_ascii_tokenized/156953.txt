<en=1>wonderful
<en=2>I went to ohm after reading some of the reviews .
<en=3>I go to school in the area and usually wait until I go home to get my hair cut .
<en=4>I decided it was time to grow up and made an appointment .
<en=5>Sierra was my stylist and i love what she did .
<en=6>I have wavy hair and she cut to my hair style .
<en=7>It was the first time i had left a salon with my hair curly .
<en=8>Usually they blow dry it out and i have to wait until i wash it to see what it will look like in its natural state .
<en=9>But she did a fabulous job letting me know what she was doing at all times and styled my hair in a way i could do it at home .
<en=10>It was n't completly impossible !!!!
<en=11>I am definitely going back
