<en=1>Best Stationery store in Bethesda
<en=2>Papeluna , a cute Mom / Pop custom printing and paper store , just opened a few days ago .
<en=3>It is right on the hustle and bustle of Wisconsin Ave but some might miss it as it is nestled in between Subway Sandwiches and Modell 's .
<en=4>I popped in after my afternoon pumpkin spice latte break at Starbucks .
<en=5>It 's an adorable little store filled with lots of stationery goodness .
<en=6>Cards , wrapping paper , paper , and an area to sit down and talk with someone to design your own invitations or for whatever else your custom printing needs may be .
<en=7>I gave the woman I spoke with today a " You 've been yelped ! " card to let her know that Yelp may be a good tool for helping spreading the word about Papeluna .
<en=8>I ended up buying a birthday card and would probably come back for more .
