<en=1>very professional / very helpful
<en=2>the people at Fidelity Leasing were very friendly and helpful .
<en=3>i was looking for a car but did not really know what i wanted and they were very helpful and took the time to first figure out what my needs were and showing me various options to meet those needs .
<en=4>they seemed more interested in helping me find the right car rather then just make a sale .
<en=5>my experience with them was great - low stress , very helpful and very personal .
