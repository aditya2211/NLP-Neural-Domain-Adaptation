<en=1>Outdated but not bad
<en=2>So I really felt like this place was extremely outdated especially since the pictures make it look nice and modern .
<en=3>It had listed that there was a hot breakfast but all this meant is that they added a waffle maker to the common continental affair at most cheap hotels .
<en=4>The family suite was basically two rooms with a small opening between them which worked great for us because we were two families traveling together .
<en=5>If you are in town and need that kind of space I say stay here but if you are looking for a little more upscale affair do n't let the pictures fool you and book somewhere else .
