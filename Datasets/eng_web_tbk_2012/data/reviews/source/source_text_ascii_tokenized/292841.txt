<en=1>Absolutely the best little motel on the coast !
<en=2>I 've stayed at this fabulous little motel two years running , and I have to say it 's one of the best lodging experiences I 've ever had on the coast ... and I 'm even comparing it to the big resorts I 've stayed at !
<en=3>A large group of my friends and I rent almost the whole motel every year for a weekend , and the experience and stay have always been five - star .
<en=4>The rooms are SO clean , the managers / owners are the nicest people , the place feels so homey , and the location and grounds are beautiful .
<en=5>There 's a restaurant nearby ( walking distance ) with a great breakfast , and a market across the street .
<en=6>The motel is very well maintained , and the managers are so accomodating , it 's kind of like visiting family each year ! ;-)
<en=7>I honestly ca n't rave enough about this place ... it 's really a hidden gem worth checking out !
