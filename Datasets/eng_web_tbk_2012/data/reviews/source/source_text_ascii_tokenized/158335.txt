<en=1>junkie lube ?!
<en=2>really weird place , I was driving home from work thought I 'd stop in for an oil change and well , there are a few guys in jiffy lube uniforms sitting at the table drinking beers and shooting the breeze .
<en=3>The neon lighting sign still said " on " yet some guy who seemed to be the oldest of the bunch , more like the drunkest of the bunch told me they 'd be open tomorrow .
<en=4>I asked if a manager was on duty he told me he was .
<en=5>WOW !
<en=6>grey shirt " mark " of course with this type behavior he could have been wearing someon else s clothing .....
