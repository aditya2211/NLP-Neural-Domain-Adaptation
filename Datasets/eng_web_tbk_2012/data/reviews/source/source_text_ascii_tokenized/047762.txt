<en=1>My Favorite place at Wildwood
<en=2>I have been going to the Wildwood , NJ for over 30 years for summer vacations and always call the Madrid first .
<en=3>I rated it 5 stars .
<en=4>I am not saying it is a 5 star hotel .
<en=5>I am saying when comparing all other hotels in Wildwood , this hotel has everything that we are looking for .
<en=6>It is the hospitality from Tom and staff , that makes it feel like a 5 star hotel in the middle of the beach .
<en=7>We prefer the layout of rooms and it is always clean .
