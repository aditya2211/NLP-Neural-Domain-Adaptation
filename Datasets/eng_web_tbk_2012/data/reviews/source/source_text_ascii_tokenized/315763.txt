<en=1>Love my home at Creekside
<en=2>I moved to Creekside Apartments in August 2008 with a 6 - month lease and have just extended it for another 13 months !
<en=3>The management from Julie and Janice to the work staff , esp. Edwin , are just wonderful .
<en=4>They have been extremely helpful whenever I have asked for help .
<en=5>Although the apartments are facing Stokes Street and close to the Bascom Light Rail , the location is surprisingly quiet .
<en=6>I have never had any problems with loud neighbors or concerns about safety .
<en=7>The apartments are within walking distance to Trader Joe 's , Whole Foods , and other stores .
<en=8>The well - equipped , clean gym is a plus !
<en=9>Great place to live if you work in and around downtown San Jose !
