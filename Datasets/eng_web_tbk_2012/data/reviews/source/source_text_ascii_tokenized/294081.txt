<en=1>DINING AT TEXAS ROADHOUSE
<en=2>TEXAS ROADHOUSE HAS VERY GOOD MEALS , THAT THE MEAT COMES RIGHT OFF THE BONES .
<en=3>IT HAS VERY GOOD PRICES .
<en=4>ON A BAD NOTE THE WAITING AREA IS NOT ENJOYABLE OR ENOUGH SEATS .
<en=5>ALSO , THERE SHOULD NOT BE PEANUTS ALL OVER THE FLOOR .
<en=6>NEXT , THERE SHOULD ONLY BE ONE PERSON BRINGING YOU YOUR FOOD .
<en=7>IT S NOT A BIG DEAL BUT I HAD TO TAKE MY SALAD HOME BECAUSE THEY FORGOT TO BRING IT .
<en=8>I HAD TO ASK THE GIRL WHO BROUGHT MY FOOD AND SHE NEVER CAME BACK TO LET ME KNOW .
<en=9>I HAD TO WAIT FOR MY WAITRESS .
<en=10>WHEN YOU FIRST COME IN THE HOSTESS IS NOT VERY FRIENDLY , THERE IS JUST A BUNCH OF WORKERS STANDING THERE .
<en=11>I WAS THERE ON MARCH 6TH , 2009 .
<en=12>I WAS ALSO THERE OF JULY 4TH 2008 , WHEN MY DAUGHTER S BUFFALO WINGS CAME OUT WITH A FLY ON IT .
<en=13>THE MANAGER CAME OVER AND SAID HE WAS SORRY AND GAVE A NEW BATCH OF WINGS , HE SAID WE CA NT REALLY DO ANYTHING BECAUSE THE DOORS ARE ALWAYS OPENING AND CLOSING .
<en=14>IN MY OPINION SHOULD OF JUST TOOK OFF THE PRICE OF THE WINGS FROM THE BILL .
<en=15>BUT EVERYONE HAS THERE OWN WAY !!!!!!
