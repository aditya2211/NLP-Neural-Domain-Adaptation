<en=1>The best there is in service .
<en=2>I was recently traveling down I - 24 from Nashville with my 3 young children and had a blowout on the southeast side of Murfreesboro .
<en=3>It was 4:50 when a friend told me to call Bud , he would take care of me .
<en=4>Not only did they answer the phone at 4:50 on a Thursday , they hit the ground moving !.
<en=5>They tracked down the only tire that fit my BMW 330i in Murfreesboro within minutes and secured it , then they came out , took off my tire ( it was a runflat - but runflats do n't do you any good if they blow out ) , and brought it to their shop to change the tire .
<en=6>They were back quickly considering how far outside of Murfreesboro we were and had us on our way by 6:30 that evening .
<en=7>Thanks Bud for all of your help and taking time away from your family that evening .
<en=8>It 's without a doubt , the best service experience I 've ever had and just to be clear , the price he charged me was the same as my tire guy in Nashville 's price for putting on the other rear tire .
<en=9>I hope I can return the favor in the future !
