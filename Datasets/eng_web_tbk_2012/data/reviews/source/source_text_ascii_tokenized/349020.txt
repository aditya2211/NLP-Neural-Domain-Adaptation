<en=1>I purchased a 2 - year old certified pre-owned BMW from this dealership .
<en=2>The night I drove back home , I found that the rear window has some leakage .
<en=3>( You can hear the wind while driving on highway .
<en=4>Very likely it needs a new window seal ) .
<en=5>I admit that I should have paid attention to this kind of little things while test drive .
<en=6>( But this is a certified car from a dealer . )
<en=7>So I brought the car back the second day .
<en=8>They told me that this is not under warranty and want to charge me $ 175 just to diagnose the problem !
<en=9>Who knows how much they want me to pay to fix this thing .
<en=10>I walked away .
<en=11>So my advice is that NEVER TRUST THIS DEALER .
<en=12>STAY AWAY AS FAR AS POSSIBLE .
