<en=1>Great Barber
<en=2>Firstly , the other reviewer clearly has never been to Nick 's , or he would know that Nick only charges $ 13 for a haircut which is pretty much industry standard .
<en=3>I have been going to Nick for 5 months now precisely because he does pay attention to detail .
<en=4>I have terrible hair and he really takes his time to make it look right .
<en=5>Some of the younger kids that work there are a bit sub par , but if you wait for Nick ... you 'll be good .
