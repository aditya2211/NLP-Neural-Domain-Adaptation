<en=1>Excellent Service and Reasonable Prices
<en=2>Boutique stores dealing in children 's clothing / gifts are often outrageously priced ( who wants to pay 40 dollars for a newborn onesie ? )
<en=3>but I was pleasantly surprised to find that the Purple Goose 's prices are reasonable ( for the SAME products found at other area boutiques , the prices were 20 - 25 % cheaper ) .
<en=4>The service was also excellent - friendly , helpful and informative without being overbearing .
<en=5>Will definitely return .
