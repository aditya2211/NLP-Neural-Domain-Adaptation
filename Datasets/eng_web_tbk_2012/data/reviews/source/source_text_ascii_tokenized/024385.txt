<en=1>Another great business bites the dust !
<en=2>The best cakes EVER !
<en=3>A bit pricey , so I did n't go very often , but it was always a treat when I did .
<en=4>The prices were worth what I got .
<en=5>I 'm assuming they are completely out of business since I ca n't find any contact information .
<en=6>I 'm hoping the bakers continue to do their baking out of another place , because it would be a shame not to have these cakes any longer .
