<en=1>They wo n't have a second chance from me .
<en=2>First , let me state that although I live in NYC , I am not from NYC , I do n't care about baseball and I absolutely love Boston to death ( so beautiful , so clean , so awesome ) .
<en=3>That said , I hated this restaurant .
<en=4>The service was just about as good as I 'd get in NYC ( that means it was poor ) and the food was almost mediocre .
<en=5>The decor left a lot to be desired and the posters telling me all the reasons 99 was great just served as an ironic contrast against the reality .
<en=6>Personally I recommend you take your money elsewhere
