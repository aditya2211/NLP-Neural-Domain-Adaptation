<en=1>I would NEVER recommend this gym to anyone and unfortunately this is based solely on the owner 's own unprofessionalism .
<en=2>When I originally joined in January I only did so because I was told I would be able to cancel the 12 month membership if I was to move away .
<en=3>I signed up with one of the staff who was very pleasant and professional .
<en=4>Actually working out there was good - the machines are nice and the classes are fun .
<en=5>The locker room is certainly lacking - I would never shower or change there .
<en=6>They need to update the locker rooms ASAP .
<en=7>Back to my poor rating - I was excepted to medical school and went in to cancel my membership as I was told I could do since I was moving away .
<en=8>The owner was VERY rude , accused me of not reading my contract , and basically told me to shut up when I was trying to ask questions to further understand the process of canceling my membership .
<en=9>I was able to cancel it but only after paying a $ 50 fee ( which the staff person who signed me up stated I would not have to pay if I had proof of moving ) and being spoken to in a very belittling manner .
<en=10>I would understand if I was being treated this way by a staff member but the club 's actual OWNER ?!
<en=11>Bad for business .
<en=12>I was appalled .
<en=13>I will never recommend this gym to any woman .
<en=14>The equipment and classes are n't good enough to deal with the rudeness from the staff !!!
<en=15>There are better places on the Cape - FITNESS 500 !
