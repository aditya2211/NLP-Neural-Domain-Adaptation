<en=1>Might try again
<en=2>Pros : * Jill , the owner , is very nice and really cares about her feedback * Pretty nice atmosphere * Great Dessert * Not your typical veggie selection , I like !
<en=3>Do n't know where else you can find Purple Hull Peas and some of the other sides .
<en=4>Cons : * Server was n't very pleasant * Pretty small portion on the blackened catfish * Overcooked food * Time , took about 25 minutes from ordering to eating .
<en=5>Half the tables and bar were empty by this point .
<en=6>Other Thoughts : Will try this place again .
<en=7>There must be a reason so many people like it there .
<en=8>Their Club sandwich looks tasty , maybe that 'll change my mind .... and a different server .
