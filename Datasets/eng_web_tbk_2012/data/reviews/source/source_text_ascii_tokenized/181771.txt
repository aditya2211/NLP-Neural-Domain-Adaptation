<en=1>the 2010 Genesis is grrrrrrrreeeaaat !
<en=2>I am a proud owner of a brand new 2010 Hyundai Genesis .
<en=3>I have never seen this car before until this lady at wal mart had it and she told me she got it here and that everyone was so nice to her .
<en=4>I asked her who she worked with and she just told me ti was the sales manager .
<en=5>I took the weekend off and came in and asked for the manager who is Jeff and he remembered her right away even remembered her dog , I was a bit shocked that someone would pay that close attention .
<en=6>We got to talking and he got me set up and I test drove with Craig and I fell head over heels for this car all I kept saying , " was I got ta have it ! "
<en=7>I thouhgt it would be out of my price range but they really worked with me and now I could nt be happier .
<en=8>Jeff and Craig are really good at what they do and know exactly how to treat a customer .
<en=9>Definitely go see them !
