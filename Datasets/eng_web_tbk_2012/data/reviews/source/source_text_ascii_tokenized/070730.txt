<en=1>We decided to try this place last night because we noticed that it had some interesting things on the menu aside from the usual rolls -- live scallop sashimi , duck breast nigiri with foie gras , panko mussels -- but none of these were particularly great or worth the sticker price .
<en=2>Additionally we tried the Logan Circle roll , spicy crab and tuna roll , and sweet potato tempura roll ( $ 15 , $ 10 , and $ 3.75 respectively ) .
<en=3>The sweet potato tempura roll was actually a great surprise : cheap and delicious , the only thing we tried that I would say was well worth it and a great value ( and I never get vegetarian rolls ) .
<en=4>The other rolls were n't at all special , especially given their pricing .
<en=5>The bottom line is that the food is n't great and is relatively high - priced .
<en=6>The service is solicitous , the atmosphere is nice and mod except the out - of - place flat - screen TV playing football .
<en=7>But I 'd go elsewhere unless the prices are cut .
<en=8>It 's just not worth it .
