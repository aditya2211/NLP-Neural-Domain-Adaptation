<en=1>You can fool people
<en=2>This store is proof that you can fool people with good advertising .
<en=3>They convince lots of people that they are a great store , when in fact they are a very average place at best , they are just another big box store like the others .
<en=4>They offer sales that are n't really sales , mislabeled items that make the item sound like a good deal when it is n't , a bad attitude about return items , and on and on .
<en=5>With higher than average prices to boot !
<en=6>So do n't get taken in , keep your eyes open if you choose to shop here .
<en=7>On the other hand , the Richmond Ukrops chain is known for its charity work , its community action , and its interest in the public welfare .
