<en=1>My Favorite in McLean
<en=2>My family loves coming to Endo Sushi . They are very nice , it is never crowded , and the food is wonderful , very delicious and fresh !
<en=3>Sometimes it is hard to get parking in the lot in front of the storefront , and it is on a one - way street , but the restaurant itself is NEVER overcrowded .
<en=4>If you can not park in the lot , then you can park in the shopping center 's garage , and walk up to Endo Sushi .
<en=5>The service is fast .
<en=6>Be sure to ring the little bell on your way out if you enjoyed your meal !
<en=7>( it 's by the door , on the hostess stand )
