<en=1>The Best Service Ever !!
<en=2>I have never had better service .
<en=3>My car broke down and roadside towed my vehicle to Sussman Kia .
<en=4>They squeezed me in and had me back up and running in no time .
<en=5>Everyone was pleasant and very helpful .
<en=6>The service department even gave me a ride home and picked me up when my car was finished .
<en=7>The advisor kept me up to date and informed on the progress of my vehicle .
<en=8>I give this dealer an A + !
