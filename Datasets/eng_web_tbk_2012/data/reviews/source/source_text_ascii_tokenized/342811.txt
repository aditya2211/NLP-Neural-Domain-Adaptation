<en=1>Friendly staff , but definitely some problems
<en=2>May , 2009 .
<en=3>We were booked at the Sheraton with a number of other out - of - town wedding guests .
<en=4>Got put into the wrong room the first night , and were quite surprised to have someone with the same room key trying to get in the door at 1:00 am !
<en=5>Next day got moved into another room , on the same floor with other wedding guests .
<en=6>There were 3 adults in our room but towels for only 2 , no linens for sofa bed .
<en=7>In the second room it took 3 tries to get all the towels and linens we requested .
<en=8>A package and some wedding cards were left in our first room .
<en=9>They were sent to our second room and had been opened -- the ribbon - wrapped present , and all 3 envelopes .
<en=10>Security in the hotel seemed to be excellent , but we were never given an explanation as to why someone would open these items .
<en=11>A mid-afternoon " fire drill " was disruptive , putting everyone out of the hotel .
<en=12>When we called the front desk about an extremely boisterous crowd in the hall outside our door quite late at night , it seemed to take the hotel staff quite a while to quiet them down .
<en=13>The staff was friendly , especially the front desk female supervisor , and seemed to want to help , but too many unusual things happened to make us want to stay there again .
