<en=1>Dr. Strzalka at Flagship CVTS is not a good doctor
<en=2>I am not sure about the quality of the other doctors there , but i do know from personal experience that Dr. Christopher T. Strzalka is not a man of his word , and is also very CRUEL AND UNCARING !!
<en=3>He was going to operate and replace my bicuspid aortic valve due to critical aortic stenosis .
<en=4>I had a surgery date of July 17 , 2008 .
<en=5>Then he renigged when he read my Health Care Proxy , even though i agreed to be on the ventilator for 2 months following surgery ( as he had twice stated i must agree to ) .
<en=6>He later said that by 2 months he " meant at least two months " .
<en=7>Two months and at least two months are totally different things .
<en=8>He did not even give me the chance to say i would stay on the ventilator longer , which i would have .
<en=9>A Health Care Proxy is not written in stone and can be changed .
<en=10>He also never even said he was sorry .
<en=11>Just said i was inoperable and walked out of the hospital room .
<en=12>So , therefore , now he says i am inoperable ( even though i am not 100 % inoperable ) , and he is letting me die .
<en=13>I am just middle aged and do not want to die , but thanks to this doctor i have no other alternatives .
<en=14>I , along with my friends , consider this doctor to be the cause of my death as he is not even trying to save my life by operating .
<en=15>Even my PA i went to the other day said " it must by comforting to have gone to a heart surgeon like him who will do nothing for you " .
<en=16>He said it sarcastically .
<en=17>If you want a doctor who will lie to you and say he will operate and then change his mind , and not know what he is talking about when he recommends procedures at other hospitals and says they are what you need , when they will not work for you , go to this doctor ... he is the one for you .
