<en=1>This place is bad .
<en=2>It 's dark , dingy & dirty .
<en=3>The salads are limp and the rest of the food is n't any better ( ok , the nachos are not too bad ! )
<en=4>This place may have been something sometime ; but it way past it " sell by date " .
<en=5>I have eaten here twice in the past year and will not go back and can not recommend it .
