<en=1>They do n't seem to be interested in selling cars .
<en=2>Went there yesterday : we are trying to decide between two different Honda models , so we wanted to test - drive both back to back .
<en=3>The salesperson refused !
<en=4>Claimed he was too busy for two test drives .
<en=5>We were the only customers there !
<en=6>Do n't waste time , just drive 10 minutes more down to Stevens Creek , they actually do try to help their customers there !
