<en=1>Pho - nomenal !!
<en=2>I have been eating Pho for almost my entire life and I 've always gone to the Pho places in south philly and off the boulevard and even the other one in chinatown , but when i tried this pho place , it blew the other pho houses away !!
<en=3>all of the pho places taste the same to me , so what seperates one from the other is the service and the price .
<en=4>The service here is incredible compared to the other places .
<en=5>the only down fall of this pho house is the difficulty in finding parking in chinatown .
<en=6>remember to bring cash since they do n't take debit or credit .
<en=7>hope this helps !!
