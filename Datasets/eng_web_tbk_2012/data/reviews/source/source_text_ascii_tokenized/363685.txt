<en=1>Lots of rules , phantom innkeeper , last minute price was worth it .
<en=2>I called the " 207 " number and listened to the same recording loop 3 times before I gave up .
<en=3>I then called the 800 number ( which was answered ) and inquired about last minute rates .
<en=4>They had a room with a $ 99 rate , which I booked .
<en=5>The room was supposed to be on the 2nd floor , but they put us on the 3rd .
<en=6>The email confirmation ( which I read in the car ) warned about large suitcases , declaring that we are innkeepers , not longshoreman .
<en=7>In other words , they do not help with suitcases , but they promise totes to help .
<en=8>However upon our arrival no one there ( the inn was open ) .
<en=9>So no totes .
<en=10>Finally a chambermaid stuck her head around the corner from the top of the stairs and told us sternly that we could not be accommodated until 3 M , no exceptions .
<en=11>Then she was gone .
<en=12>We returned after 3 PM , found no one there , and a note from the innkeeper with directions to our room .
<en=13>Rules in the room : # 1 ) if you drink the soda from the fridge in your room you must prove it by leaving the can in the trash .
<en=14>If they think you 've taken a soda from your room home with you , they will charge you $ 1.50 per can .
<en=15>They count the cans in the trash to make sure .
<en=16># 2 ) If you take the shampoo products home , they will charge you $ 8 per item .
<en=17># ) If you want a late checkout , ( after 11 AM ) they charge you $ 15 for the first hour , $ 25 for the second hour , and after 2 PM it 's a full day charge .
<en=18># 4 ) Breakfast is 8 AM to 10 AM .
<en=19>No earlier and no later .
<en=20>If you go later , it 's all cleaned up .
<en=21>( By whom , I do n't know .
<en=22>I never saw anyone there .
<en=23>All these rules are posted in the rooms . )
<en=24>Snacks : uninspired bread , tea backs , and individual coffee things for a machine that did n't exist .
<en=25>I put the coffee thing in hot water and settled for a cup of weak coffee .
<en=26>No wine glasses .
<en=27>Room was clean , but had a weird , dated , sink / stove combo that did n't work .
<en=28>Bath was clean except shower stall which had mildew problems .
<en=29>No tub .
<en=30>The Inn touts a shower with dual shower heads , but only one worked .
<en=31>Do n't get the rooms off the two kitchens .
<en=32>They are RIGHT OFF the kitchen so you hear everything .
<en=33>Free parking .
<en=34>I 'd go back if I could get the last minute rate again of $ 99 , but I would n't pay their rack rate .
