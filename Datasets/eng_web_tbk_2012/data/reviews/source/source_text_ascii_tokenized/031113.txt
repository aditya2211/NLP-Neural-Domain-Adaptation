<en=1>Good Pizza at a good price
<en=2>I just moved nearby and have tried several of the local places , this was the first one and I should have just stuck with it .
<en=3>The pizza is usually pretty good , the only bad one we got was on a Friday night and it just needed to be cooked a little more , but it was still good .
<en=4>Their BBQ chicken pizza is one of the better ones I have ever had .
