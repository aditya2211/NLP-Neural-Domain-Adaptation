<en=1>Perfect Location plus
<en=2>I moved into the Tanglewood Apartments in late 2008 and it 's been a refreshing change .
<en=3>I used to live at Meadowrun and that was a nightmare .
<en=4>The manager - Tiffany - is actually very nice so I 'm a bit surprised by other comments .
<en=5>She 's very reachable and she has always responded quickly to any questions or requests .
<en=6>Plus she plans a monthly breakfasts and other events at the clubhouse which is a nice added benefit .
