<en=1>Alto delivers on all levels .
<en=2>From the moment you enter the restaurant , you know you are some place special .
<en=3>The service is impeccable , and the food is even better .
<en=4>I highly recommend the four - course tasting menu , which gives you plenty of range and food to satisfy your appetite .
<en=5>Also , if you are into wine , Alto has the depth of both region , varietal , and vintage to satisfy nearly any sommelier ( or after 9 pm , bring your own bottle for free ... no corking fee ! ) .
<en=6>While it 's not cheap , Alto will give you an experience you 'll never forget .
