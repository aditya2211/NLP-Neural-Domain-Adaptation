<en=1>Small Firm with Great Service
<en=2>Bloom Legal was really attentive to my problem , and Seth Bloom took the time to help me understand the legal issue I was dealing with .
<en=3>I much preferred the one - on - one service here to the experiences I 've had with bigger offices and firms .
<en=4>While I hope I do n't have any need for a lawyer anytime soon , if I do I 'll definitely use this firm again .
