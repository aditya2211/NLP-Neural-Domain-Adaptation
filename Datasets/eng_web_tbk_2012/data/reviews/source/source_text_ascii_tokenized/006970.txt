<en=1>Wife and I attempted to adopt a dog and was nothing but frustrating .
<en=2>We arrived Sunday at about 230 and found a do we really liked .
<en=3>We were told that we could n't today because they were closing soon .
<en=4>I called the next morning to let then know my wife would be driving in .
<en=5>They gave me the run around and missing paperwork only to call back to tell me someone else wanted her and I would need to come in and put down a deposit .
<en=6>I work 2 hours away but offered my card over the phone .
<en=7>They refused .
<en=8>Terrible communication as well .
<en=9>At one point they told me the dog had been fixed , the next day it had n't .
<en=10>Huge ammount of time wasted time and elevated blood pressure .
