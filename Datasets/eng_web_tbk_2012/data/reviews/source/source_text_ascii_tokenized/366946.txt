<en=2>Good place to be on a Sunday Night .
<en=3>The beers were good , nice choice of beers as well , and as usual the mussels were great , the place upstairs is a nice addition to the bar downstairs .
<en=4>Filled up on too much beer and hence can not comment on the food .
<en=5>But the menu had standard stuff that one would get at a Belgian Tavern .
<en=6>If you are a handcraft beer person , this is a fantastic place to be .
