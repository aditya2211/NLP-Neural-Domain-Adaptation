<en=1>Quit with the overstatements !
<en=2>The worst thing that can happen for any restaurant like Zahav is to have too many people write hyperbolic reviews making claims that " everyone " is going to " love " the food , decor and service .
<en=3>The truth is , in my and my dining partners ' experience , this is a fine little restaurant with some unique food .
<en=4>It 's an entirely up and down experience , however .
<en=5>Now , the best of that unique food comes at the very beginning of the meal .
<en=6>The salatim salads are the smallest plates I 've ever seen placed in front of me ( you would most likely think they were condiments if it were n't explained to you ) .
<en=7>Though they are mostly excellent , you generally do n't get enough forkfuls to know if you really love them .
<en=8>That being said , the laffa and hummus are out of this world .
<en=9>Then again , for the three of us who dined together , two pieces of flatbread left us fighting for more , and licking the hummus from our fingers ( and yes , those two pieces of flatbread did represent a three - person order ) .
<en=10>Dinner was also an up - and - down experience .
<en=11>The vegetarian dishes and lighter fare were almost always spot - on , while the lamb was often dry and / or overcooked .
<en=12>The duck was a 65 % glob of chewy fat with no resemblance to the juicy , crispy delicacy it usually represents at other establishments .
<en=13>Dessert was ... hmmm , that 's interesting , I do n't even remember dessert .
<en=14>I guess that tells you a lot .
<en=15>Oh , yes , the chocolate semifreddo was quite good .
<en=16>The warm chocolate cake was very tasty , but served at room temperature , not warm by any stretch of the imagination .
<en=17>And my -- no , I still do n't remember what I had .
<en=18>Service was average , but nothing special , and restaurants that are supposed to be excellent should do a better job of training their waitstaff to be communicative and friendly , not merely capable .
<en=19>Perhaps had we not gone into this restaurant believing Zahav was going to be golden as its name suggests ( and as the many golden reviews seem to attest ) , we would have enjoyed a decent little expensive experience .
<en=20>But one should not go here expecting something fantastic , unless perhaps you 've never had middle - eastern food before , or succulent duck , tasty lamb , decent portion sizes or actually warm chocolate desserts .
<en=21>PS ) When we called for a reservation , we were told that 5:00 and 9:30 were their only openings .
<en=22>When we arrived at 5 , and left circa 7 , there were the same 4 or 5 empty tables surrounding us .
<en=23>Did they think we were going to feel lucky to get any reservation at all , and therefore be more pleased with our dining experience ?
