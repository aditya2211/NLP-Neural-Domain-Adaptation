<en=1>First trip to Canada
<en=2>I recently traveled to Canada on business and had a most excellent experience .
<en=3>I work for a large retail company recently expanding our operations into Canada and had to travel to ensure all of our computer network equipment was installed properly and on time .
<en=4>This can tend to be a stressful experience in itself let alone adding crossing boarders for the first time .
<en=5>I was very pleased to find my accommodations and the hotel staff to be a very calming and comforting part of my trip .
<en=6>I found the hotel to be amazingly clean , not to mention very well adorned with many pleasant surprises .
<en=7>From my first encounter at check in to my regrettable check out I found the staff and facility to exceed my expectation .
<en=8>I completely enjoyed my whole check in experience and was impressed with the friendliness and professionalism of the staff as well as the accommodations themselves .
<en=9>I will be traveling in this area in the future and you can be assured that this experience will be helpful in my choice of hotels and Novotel will be my first selection .
<en=10>Yes the parking can be a challenge but being from NJ I am no stranger to tight corners .
<en=11>Please pass my appreciation to the Staff and Management for their excellent hospitality and good spirits as it helped make a stressful trip enjoyable .
