<en=1>Rude service
<en=2>even though I have never tried hoa salon but I agree with other reviewers that they are rude .
<en=3>I called and asked about the price for hair updo and the receptionist or owner who aswered the phone refused to tell me , or even just give me an approximate price range .
<en=4>He told us to stop by the salon and then he will tell us the price .
<en=5>What kind of rude service is that ?
<en=6>I do n't want to waste my time with them .
