<en=1>Excellent service
<en=2>I could easily go to Nordstrom for my designer jeans and pay the same price , but I go to the Garment District for their service .
<en=3>Previous reviewers said they were pushy and I can understand that , but I find the staff more helpful than anything else .
<en=4>Tiffany is fabulous !
<en=5>I came in for alterations ( free , by the way ) and told her about a stain I had on my new leather purse .
<en=6>She immediately went to the back , brought out leather cleaner and cleaned my purse on the spot .
<en=7>I did n't even buy the bag there !
<en=8>Huge selection and , great suggestions from the staff and they refer you to reliable places if they do n't have what you need .
