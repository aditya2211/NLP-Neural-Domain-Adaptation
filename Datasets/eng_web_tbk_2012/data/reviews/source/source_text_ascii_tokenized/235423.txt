<en=1>The Worst Chinese I 've Ever Had
<en=2>This is by far the worst chinese food I have ever had .
<en=3>The service stunk .
<en=4>I called in my order and upon arriving to pick it up , they got my order confused with someone else s .
<en=5>They helped about three other people before they offered to help me again .
<en=6>They also got my friend s order mixed up and wanted to charger her $ 10 more than what she had wanted .
<en=7>She asked for the dinner combo and they gave her two dinner plates instead .
<en=8>We were standing in the store for 20 minutes to simply pick up an order .
<en=9>Not to mention that the wait staff was about as pleasant as dealing with an angry bull .
<en=10>They were abrasive and rude - when they were the ones who messed everything up .
<en=11>We had to throw out about 80 percent of our meals because the food tasted so horrible .
<en=12>I do nt know how it is possible to make orange chicken , sesame chicken and kung pao chicken as well as cheese puffs taste THAT bad but China Delight accomplished that .
<en=13>The only thing that was edible was the steamed rice and the vegetable lo mein was barely tolerable .
<en=14>I will NEVER go here again .
<en=15>Lucky Panda in Willis is a billion times better in service and quality of the meal .
<en=16>I have no idea how China Delight won number 1 Chinese restaurant in Montgomery - There needs to be a recount on that vote .
