<en=1>I was thoroughly impressed !
<en=2>I had a problem with the tile in my bathroom coming apart .
<en=3>I called a few different businesses in the area to get estimates , they were n't the cheapest I found but very reasonable .
<en=4>The best part is I got my whole bathroom remodeled for about the same price the other compan's were quoting just to fix the shower tile and fixtures .
<en=5>They had the work done in about half the time quoted which made me and my wife extremely happy .
<en=6>We have had nothing but compliments on our bathroom when guest come over - who would have guessed that one ?
<en=7>Very nice work and friendly guys too .
<en=8>Best money I 've spent on remodeling ever .
<en=9>I highly recommend any one considering home repair to give these guys a call .
