<en=1>Anna Marie and Govind are very sweet people , and the minute you steep into their school , the calm loving atmosphere takes over , and tension and worries stay outside in the street , whether or not you pick them up again after class is probably a question of practice .
<en=2>A wonderful place , if you want more than just the physical side of yoga .
<en=3>Give yourself the gift of trying this place , to see if it fits you ...
