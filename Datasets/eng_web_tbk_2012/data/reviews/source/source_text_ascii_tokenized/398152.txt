<en=1>Con Garage
<en=2>I brought my car in for a simple emissions test .
<en=3>I guess they figured me for an easy mark , and tried to explain that my car would n't pass unless I replaced a hose .
<en=4>Ten minutes later , I took my car down the street and it passed the emissions test with flying colors .
<en=5>If you 're a fan of herpes , being ripped off , and child molesters , this is the garage for you .
<en=6>If not , go somewhere else .
