<en=1>Over-rated
<en=2>Buddakan inevitably attracts the majority of its guests simply because of its association with Steven Starr , but that does n't impress me .
<en=3>The atmosphere alone deserves 4 stars but , the food was not up to par with the price tag and the reputation the restaurant carries .
<en=4>The server we had was knowledgeable but he was not as proper as he should have been , acting like he was talking to his friends rather than his customers .
<en=5>The angry lobster was completely over-priced !
<en=6>$ 80 for a dish that has about one small lobster tail and is full of filler vegetables !
<en=7>I would n't go there again .
