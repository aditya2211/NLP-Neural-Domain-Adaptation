<en=2>I have had my back fused in 2 places .
<en=3>I wish that I had n't done this .
<en=4>With these fusions , chiropractric is n't as successful , but it still is very helpful .
<en=5>Even after my fusions , my back continued to hurt , but now it does n't hurt any more .
<en=6>I would encourage anyone who is thinking of back surgery , to talk about different treatment options first with Dr. de Barros .
<en=7>He really knows what he is talking about and will approach the different options fairly .
<en=8>You can see different treatments that a surgeon ca n't see , so that you can have several treatment options before you decide what to do .
