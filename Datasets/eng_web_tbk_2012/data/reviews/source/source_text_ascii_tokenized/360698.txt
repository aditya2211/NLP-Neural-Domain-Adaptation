<en=1>It s been a few years since I have been to Ipanema .
<en=2>But my wife and I first went there thinking it would be Brazilian food ( think lots of meat ) , but it turned out to be a vegan restaurant !
<en=3>And , I can say , this was one of my favorite places to eat in all of Richmond .
<en=4>Amazing !
<en=5>Do n't let the nondescript building entrance fool you , these are some creative and talented chefs ... two thumbs way , way up !
