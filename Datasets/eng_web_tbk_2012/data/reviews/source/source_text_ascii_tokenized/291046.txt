<en=1>Ham s on Friendly ... RIP
<en=2>This is the original Ham 's restaurant , expanded into a regional chain in the late 80's -- but this one is no more .
<en=3>Victim of hard times and I suspect failing corporate management .
<en=4>According to news accounts , the company is struggling .
<en=5>I have many fond memories of my college evenings there long ago .
<en=6>So long Ham s ... you will be missed .
