<en=1>As a native southern Californian I can tell you that this is not authentic Mexican food .
<en=2>However , I still like this place a lot .
<en=3>Esp. the mole , tortilla soup , and guacamole .
<en=4>Margaritas are alright .
<en=5>My only complaint is the QUESO .
<en=6>It used to be fabulous , why did you guys change it ??
<en=7>Queso should not be watery :( .....
<en=8>*** update *** NEVER MIND !
<en=9>They fixed the queso !
<en=10>Thank you thank you
