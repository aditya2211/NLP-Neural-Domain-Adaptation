<en=1>DO NOT GO HERE !!!
<en=2>I went to get my nails filled Friday , by Monday 2 were broken .
<en=3>I was not happy with the way they looked , very wavy , uneven edges , and with the exception of 1 , there is a dip in the center of each nail .
<en=4>I also had a pedicure , and they cut my nails too short , one of my big toes looks like it s getting infected .
