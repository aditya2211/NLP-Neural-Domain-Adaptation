<en=1>Good location
<en=2>For a hotel like this you would expect some form of free internet .
<en=3>What you get is a $ 13 / day charge to access the internet through a slow 512 / 512 kb / s that you can only use to check email etc ( Read : No downloading ) .
<en=4>Other than that the hotel is in a good location and the breakfast is great
