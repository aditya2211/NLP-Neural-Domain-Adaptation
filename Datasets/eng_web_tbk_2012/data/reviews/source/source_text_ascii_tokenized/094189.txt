<en=2>They close whenever they feel like it , often well before their listed closing time .
<en=3>Their store is dusty , dirty and feels like you 're stepping into the 1970s .
<en=4>They do n't take coupons .
<en=5>They have a credit card minimum .
<en=6>This place is the opposite of QuikTrip : crappy in every way .
