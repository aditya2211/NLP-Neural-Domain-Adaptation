<en=1>Over-rated ...
<en=2>This restaurant is over-rated .
<en=3>It is hard to find ... and the mexican food is bland , almost equivalent to eating out of a can .
<en=4>The service is poor ...
<en=5>I asked for a fried egg on my enchiladas ... and did not get it .!
<en=6>Secondly , the enchladas did not come with enchilada sauce .. but chili ... like Hormel 's chili .. the cheese was American cheese !
<en=7>The Chili Relleno .. had no batter on it .
