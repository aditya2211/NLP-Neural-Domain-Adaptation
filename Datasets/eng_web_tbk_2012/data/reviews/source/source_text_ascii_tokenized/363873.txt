<en=1>Worst Apartments EVER
<en=2>We lived here for 2 years , the first year or so was okay .
<en=3>Then , the more power they gave to Linda , the worse the place got .
<en=4>We were always having our water shut off , there were always people having parties at the pool , even after it was supposed to be closed .
<en=5>The pool was supposed to close at 10 and they would have people down there until 11:45 yelling , playing music and do who - knows - what in the dark corners of the pool .
<en=6>Then , when we moved out , we cleaned the apartment top to bottom , they came back and tried to charge us for two cleaning fees ( and we never got our deposit back ) and past utilities ( that were already paid , we have check numbers and records of this ) .
<en=7>Linda is the rudest person you will ever talk to and she sticks up for all of the trashy , rude people that live there , not the nice ones that actually give a crap about respecting others .
<en=8>Do not live here , you will regret it !
