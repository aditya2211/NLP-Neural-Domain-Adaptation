<en=1>I think that the re pretty good .
<en=2>First of all , if you call for an appointment they wo n't tell you to call back a month later so you can then make one .
<en=3>They also do n't tell you that they 're going to mail you an " application " to be admitted to be a patient .
<en=4>I feel that the way some doctor s offices work around here is a little bit absurd so I 'm happy that these guys do n't do those two things in particlular .
<en=5>Usually you can be seen the same week or maybe the following week .
<en=6>The doctor did tell me that my male pattern baldness is due to my mother s father because the gene is exclusively passed on through maternal line but that 's a common misconception ( http://www.consumerreports.org/health/healthy-living/beauty-personal-care/hair-loss-10-08/hair-loss.htm ) .
<en=7>In general I would say that the staff is attentive and nice .
<en=8>But then again I was nice to them so that could have been why .
<en=9>Anyhow , after reading some of the other reviews it seems like some of the other reviewers are expecting mircles .
<en=10>If you want miracles you 'll have to go to 21st St .
<en=11>It 's a pretty typical primary care office but for the area it 's very good .
<en=12>They do n't do certain things that are really annoying about other offices .
