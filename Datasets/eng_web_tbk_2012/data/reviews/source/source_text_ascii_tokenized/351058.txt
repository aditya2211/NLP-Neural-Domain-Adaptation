<en=1>One of the worst places
<en=2>This place and its sister store Peking Garden are the worst places to order from .
<en=3>the food was horrible not cooked like it should be , they got the order wrong on a number of occasions , and once forgot about my order .
<en=4>i had to call back up there two hours later and the lady ( who claimed to be a manager ) said my food was on the way , and she did nt offer to compensate me in any kind of way .
<en=5>i waited another 30 mins before receiving my food and it was cold .
<en=6>in my opinon this place should be shut down by the health inspector , and anyone who is satisfied with there service and food has never eaten at a real asian restaurant .
