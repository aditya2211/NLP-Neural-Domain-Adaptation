<en=1>Finest ??
<en=2>Really ??
<en=3>I beg to differ .
<en=4>This place is marginal at best .
<en=5>Not very welcoming and focused mostly on keeping little kids entertained .
<en=6>I was not impressed , and quite frustrated at their lack of rating for their courses .
<en=7>I understand not wanting to put labels like 5.10 on an indoor course , because yes , it is not the same , but some clear understanding of the difficulty of one course to another is nice when you are an intermediate climber looking to improve .
<en=8>I do n't want to waste my time on routes set for children , but I do n't want to take on something I ca n't handle just to strain myself to exhaustion .
<en=9>Rate the routes , with understandable markings and a more detailed system than easy , moderate , and hard .
<en=10>Again , a great outing for the kids , a frustration for an out of town climber .
