<en=1>NEVER fear going to the dentist again !
<en=2>I 'm 61 years old and have dental problems my entire life .
<en=3>By the age of 24 I stopped going to the dentist .
<en=4>My fear and discomfort from dental work scared me !
<en=5>It took all the courage I could muster to make an appointment .
<en=6>At the front door of his office , I nearly turned around .
<en=7>I considered just leaving after going inside and nearly did .
<en=8>Doctor Gonzales and his entire staff are the most professional people I have ever dealt with .
<en=9>They made me feel confident in what they would do , and treated me like a member of their own family .
<en=10>I never felt pain or discomfort .
<en=11>The ability to smile and eat again can only be described as a whole new lease on life .
<en=12>Thank you Doctor Gonzales , Doctor Stout , Eva Marie and the entire staff !
