<en=1>Great Job
<en=2>I want to say that Mike did a great job for our family in our time of need .
<en=3>Both my grandparents passed away 4 months apart and Mike was very understanding .
<en=4>It was a very trying time for my family and myself yet Mike took the time to greet each and every one one of us .
<en=5>He is very professional in his position as a director and yet he still made time to be compassionate for what we were all going through .
<en=6>I 'm sure it s not every day that a funeral director sees the same family in such a short time .
<en=7>My grandfather passed away silently in his sleep , and my grandmother passed away after a short struggle with cancer .
<en=8>Both my grandparents looked as natural as could be expected .
<en=9>Thank you Mike for all your help professionally and personally .
