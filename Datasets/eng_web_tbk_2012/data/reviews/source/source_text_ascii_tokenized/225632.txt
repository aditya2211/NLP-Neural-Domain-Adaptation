<en=1>FHS is a good high school -- c / o 1998
<en=2>I enjoyed my time at Franklin High School .
<en=3>We had relatively good facilities at the time -- decent science labs , with multiple hoods and access to good equipment ; nice gymnasiums , and a well - funded music department ( I was in the guitar ensemble ) .
<en=4>Now , of course , there 's a new building , with presumably better facilities .
<en=5>All to the good .
<en=6>For those who care , a good proportion of the my class went on to 4 - year colleges , many of them ranked in the top 50 of US News .
<en=7>If I remember , students went to Dartmouth , U. Penn , Duke , BU , William and Mary , Vassar , Howard , and Carnegie Mellon , among others .
<en=8>Many students went to Rutgers , including their top - ranked pharmacy program .
<en=9>The point is -- FHS gives you the opportunity to make it to a good college , but you need to work hard .
