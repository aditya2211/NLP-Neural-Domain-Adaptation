<en=1>Had a horrible experience with a manager here , Rachel McInnis , she was rude , inconsiderate and did not do the right thing for an item that was marked incorrectly ...
<en=2>I 'm not interested in shopping in a place with people like her ... she refused to sell me the item at its marked price even after admitting they had made a mistake .
<en=3>I normally do n't write reviews but seeing that I considered Dillards a distinguished , upscale place to shop , this one wo n't be getting my business , nor my family 's , nor my co-workers .
<en=4>It 's never ok to let a customer walk out unhappy , especially when they are right .
