<en=1>My 2004 x - type was getting close to 100,000 miles so it was time for an upgrade .
<en=2>I sent my wife and daughter over to check out a pre-owned 2009 XF .
<en=3>Michael Chestney was very pleasant and patient with my wife and she suggested I go check it out .
<en=4>I went in later that afternoon and met with Michael .
<en=5>He showed me the car I was interested in and we took a test drive .
<en=6>I loved the car so we began negotiating my trade - in and the price of the 09 XF .
<en=7>The entire negotiation took about 20 minutes .
<en=8>Fair give and take on both sides until we agreed on a deal that was within my parameters and was fair to both sides .
<en=9>10 minutes of paperwork and I was the owner of a beautiful pre-owned 09 XF .
<en=10>I have purchased over 15 vehicles ( cars , rvs , and boats ) in my lifetime and I have to say the experience with Michael and Barrett Motor Cars of San Antonio was one of the best .
<en=11>Friendly , knowledgeable , and above all fair .
<en=12>That 's all you can really ask from a car dealer and Michael and Barrett hit all 3 .
<en=13>Thanks for the great deal and the great car !
