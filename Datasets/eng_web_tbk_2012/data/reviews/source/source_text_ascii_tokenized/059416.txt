<en=1>Excellent food , fantastic wait staff
<en=2>I recently threw a surprise birthday party for my wife at Fraiser 's .
<en=3>We had 30 guests for the event , and everyone came away from the evening impressed with not only the food , but the outstanding service as well .
<en=4>The management was easy to deal with during the planning stages , and the execution by the kitchen and wait staff was flawless .
<en=5>I highly recommend Fraiser 's for anyone planning a special event for friends , family or business .
