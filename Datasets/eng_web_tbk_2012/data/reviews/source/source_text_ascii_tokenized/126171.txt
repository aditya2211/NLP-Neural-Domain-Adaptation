<en=1>Only Concerned With Money
<en=2>I have been getting my treatments for a few months now and have seen some results but not up to the standards that I was told I should expect .
<en=3>The people there attempt to come across and professional and nice , but I was disappointed with their customer service .
<en=4>Never miss an appointment because they will charge you the price of a treatment , even if you had an emergency .
<en=5>It 's pretty ridiculous !
<en=6>They want to squeeze as much as they can from you even if you just got in a car accident !!!!
<en=7>They do n't care one bit about you !!!!!
