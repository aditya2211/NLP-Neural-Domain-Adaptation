<en=1>Great work and honest establishment !
<en=2>I typically have work done on my Jeep at the dealership , but it is 6 years old now and getting charged dealership prices just did n't seem cost effective anymore .
<en=3>I had tried out few place around the area and had been ripped off a few times .
<en=4>I had hear great things about Phet and G&G Automotive so I decided to give him a try .
<en=5>The service was excellent and personable .
<en=6>He checked out what I needed to have done told me what needed be fixed before he did any work and did great repair work .
<en=7>The price was actually lower than what I had anticipated and used to compared to other places , plus he showed me the work he did when I came in to pick up the car .
<en=8>Also , a week after the work , Phet called me up to see how my car was running and to let me know that they had accidentally overcharged me for part of the work and wanted to give me a refund for that amount .
<en=9>That is just unheard of these days !
<en=10>I grew up in a small town where you knew and trusted your mechanic and was really cynical about city auto repair shops since I moved here , but Phet has shown that there really are honest hard working mechanics around .
<en=11>He is my mechanic going forward !
