<en=1>We just got our sunroom built by Patio World and can say that I 'm extremely happy with the whole thing .
<en=2>From the amount of time spent with us to explain things during the initial quote , to the communication through the approval process to the actual workmanship of the build itself .
<en=3>I have nothing bad to say .
<en=4>Very glad that we went with them .
