<en=1>Oil Change Disaster
<en=2>My wife had taken her '07 Ford Fusion in for a routine oil change .
<en=3>A couple days after the oil change , the engine ran rough , the low oil pressure light would come on sporadically , and the engine would whir loudly .
<en=4>Turns out the engine had no oil , and when oil was put it , it would just run out of the filter .
<en=5>There could have ( hopefully does n't have ) major damage to the engine .
<en=6>All of this started after their oil change .
<en=7>Once they realized their mistake they sent a mechanic and tow truck to my wife 's work and towed it back to fix it .
<en=8>I would not recommend this shop for anything , not even something as simple as an oil change .
<en=9>Plus they will overcharge you for just about everything , and smile while doing it .
