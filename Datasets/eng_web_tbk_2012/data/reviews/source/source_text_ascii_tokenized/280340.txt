<en=1>My girlfriend and I took a chance on this place because we did n't want to wait in line at Outback .
<en=2>What an amazing find - this restaurant is a GEM .
<en=3># 1 it s immaculately clean .
<en=4># 2 the decor is tasteful and artistic , from the comfortable chairs to the elegant light fixtures .... and ( most importantly ) # 3 the food is FANTASTIC .
<en=5>This is authentic Cuban cuisine ; fresh ingredients expertly prepared and seasoned perfectly .
<en=6>The portions were generous and we got out for less than the cost of one entree at some chain restaurant .
<en=7>TRY THIS PLACE - YOU 'LL LOVE IT .
