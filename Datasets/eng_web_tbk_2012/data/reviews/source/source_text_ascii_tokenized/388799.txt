<en=1>Worth Every Penny
<en=2>My girlfriend and I ate at The Grill last night , and our experience was amazing .
<en=3>Everything we ordered was prepared to perfection , and was presented perfectly .
<en=4>The asparagus , seared tuna , and lobster tail were the best we ever had .
<en=5>Then the desserts came , and they were hands down the best dessert we ever had .
<en=6>I will sum it up with , it was worth every penny !
