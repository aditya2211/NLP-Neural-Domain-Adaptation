<en=1>Cranmore Dental and Implant Clinic : I could not recommend Dr David Nelson enough .
<en=2>I had a severe phobia of attending the dentist until I met and was treated by Dr Nelson .
<en=3>He instantaneously put me at ease and his ongoing treatments have been absolutely pain free .
<en=4>My previous apprehension has been dismissed and I no longer have a sinking feeling when my next appointment is due !
<en=5>In addition to the core treatment , Dr Nelson has impressed me further with his concern and interest in the well - being of his patients - his dental work underpinned by a strong duty of care to every patient .
<en=6>He is always prepared to go the extra mile to ensure that any patient discomfort is dealt with immediately -
