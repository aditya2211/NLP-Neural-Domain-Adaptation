<en=1>A friend and I recently took our 16 and 18 month olds here .
<en=2>While there was n't too much available for their age ( ball pit , bouncy area and a little padded pyramid to climb on ) , we went right when they opened at 10 am on a winter weekday and ended up being the only ones there , so we were given a little more liberty than we would have if others had been there .
<en=3>It 's not the classiest place , but it was cleaner than I expected and the staff was very friendly .
<en=4>For $ 4 it was a nice break from the monotony of winter indoors with a toddler .
