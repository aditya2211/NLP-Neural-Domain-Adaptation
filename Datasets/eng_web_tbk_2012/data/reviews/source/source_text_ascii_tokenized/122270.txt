<en=1>Perfect Practice
<en=2>After I had chosen The Fountain Dental Practice they provided a slick and professional service from start to finish .
<en=3>Everyone was friendly from the receptionist to the surgeon herself , putting me at my ease and explaining the whole process , both initially and then as we went along .
<en=4>Surgery visit timings were always made to suit me and not them and they gave me the feeling that I mattered and was important to them .
<en=5>The surgery itself is slick , modern and very relaxed and I always felt that I was in capable hands .
<en=6>My dental surgeon , Dr. Lucy Nichols is clearly a dental perfectionist and clearly proud both of the work she does and the reputation she has established .
<en=7>Everyone was so helpful that I can not wait to go back .....
