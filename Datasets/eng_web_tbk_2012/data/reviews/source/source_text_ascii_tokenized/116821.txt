<en=1>FANFUCKINGTASTIC
<en=2>Ok I am a New Yorker who has been going to school in Oxford , England .
<en=3>I thought the UK was completely devoid of good NYC style pizza .
<en=4>I thought to get a decent pizza the only way was at a fancy restaurant , and I have to get a whole pie .
<en=5>I thought I would have to wait until I went home to NYC .
<en=6>Well then I went on a trip to Glasgow and was walking around .
<en=7>I saw this place and it looked like the HOLY GRAIL .
<en=8>I knew I had found the real deal , big pies , sold by the slice , with the pizzas sitting under the glass in the front .
<en=9>They have crushed red pepper flakes and oregano .
<en=10>So I ordered a slice .
<en=11>It tasted like I just flew back home .
<en=12>I du n no how they did it , but Scottish friends --- this is THE REAL DEAL .
<en=13>I congratulated this establishment for doing the research on making NYC pizza because these Scots fcking nailed it .
<en=14>That being said , I do n't know how their delivery service is .
<en=15>They might want to change the name to reflect the new yorkedness of the pizza , scrummy yummy sounds gimmicky to me .
