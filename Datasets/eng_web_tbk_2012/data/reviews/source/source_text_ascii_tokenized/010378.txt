<en=1>Poor Experience
<en=2>I did not have a good experience w / Dr. Ghassemlou .
<en=3>During the session , he demanded to have my physical address , which I 've always kept private as I am enrolled in a witness protection program .
<en=4>I believe he is correct in that he needs my physical address for legal reasons , however , he did not adequately explain this during our session .
<en=5>I learned more about this doing my own research afterward .
<en=6>I think he could 've done more to assuage my concerns by giving me concrete facts .
<en=7>Saying that I need to give him my address or else I have intimacy issues is not helpful .
<en=8>It 's pretty combative actually .
