<en=1>Excellent customer service and quality work .
<en=2>They went the extra mile to repair my cowboy boots -- they had to have a special kind of paper that looked like wood grain to fix the heels .
<en=3>That was 4 years ago .
<en=4>I have n't been able to find a shoe repair place in Seattle since that has been able to do it .
<en=5>( I 've been through at least 5 places already . )
<en=6>If I had time to drive to Tacoma before they closed during the work week , I would just so I could get those boots fixed properly again .
