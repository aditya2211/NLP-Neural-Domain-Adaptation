<en=1>HORRIBLE
<en=2>This school is the worst one i 've ever been to .
<en=3>I attended it for 2 years , and that was enough .
<en=4>There 's holes everywhere in the ceiling , sewage constantly leaks through the ceiling , and the whole condition of the school is horrible .
<en=5>The staff and the Principal are rediculous , they do n't listen to any input , and they make up rediculous rules ( They banned backpacks , because a teacher TRIPPED OVER a student 's ) .
<en=6>The education is horrible at best , do society a favor , and do NOT send your student here .
