<en=1>Terrible Service
<en=2>One of the worst experiences I 've ever had with a auto repair shop .
<en=3>We took our vehicle in for a repair to the air conditioning .
<en=4>Approx 4 months later , the compressor went out .
<en=5>We took it back in to have it repaired again , and less than a week later the second compressor went out .
<en=6>We went in for a third visit and they fixed it again , but this time when we picked up the car , the radio and clock did not work .
<en=7>So for the 4th time in 5 months and the third time in 2 weeks , we brought the car back again .
<en=8>When we expressed our discontent to the manager ( that 's right , the manager ) , did he say he would return some money , did he say he would give a discount on our next visit , did he just say " I 'm sorry " .
<en=9>Nope , none of the above .
<en=10>He stood there and told us how he was n't at fault .
<en=11>It was the fault of the parts supplier , and can we imagine how he felt having to put another 2 hours of work in the car .
<en=12>And what did we expect ... that he bench test every part .
<en=13>At no time during the conversation did the words , " I 'm sorry " ever come out of his mouth .
<en=14>I , nor anyone else in my family , will ever go to Sun Devil Auto again .
<en=15>Well , unless of course the third compressor he put in the car goes out .
