<en=1>Thank you !
<en=2>I recently took a rescue puppy to this Clinic and I was SHOCKED at how well Romeo and My family was treated .
<en=3>They worked around the clock to ensure that my puppy life was saved .
<en=4>We have to leave him at the vet for 3 days and I was told to call for check ups as often as I wished that no matter how many times I called I would not annoy them .
<en=5>lol They where super friendly towards us and treated us like people not walking bags of cash .
<en=6>In this day it s rare to find such wonderful people who CARE , Not the kind of want to make cash .
<en=7>I would strongly suggest you give them the chance to prove to you that not all people in this world are evil !
<en=8>I will never go to another vet as long as I have animals .
<en=9>I live nearly two hours away and yet I will still make the drive to see them !
<en=10>In fact I look forward to taking my animals to the vet simply because of how my animals and I are treated .
