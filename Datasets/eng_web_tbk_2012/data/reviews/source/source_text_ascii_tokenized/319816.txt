<en=1>AWFUL SERVICE !
<en=2>After happily visiting Sear's Automotives in the past , I was shocked at the horrible service received at their Greensboro location .
<en=3>I brought my car in on a Sunday to replace a shredded tire .
<en=4>I waited about 20 minutes in the store part before anyone was able to assist me and was then told to pull my car into the shop ( that is apparently what you are supposed to do , but the big signs pointing you that way are for some reason kept inside the garage , so you do n't see them drving up , and they purposely block the front pull - up that all other Sear's use ) .
<en=5>Once inside , I had to stand around for at least 10 more minutes before -- FINALLY -- a technician got to me .
<en=6>Once I returned to pick up my car , you can believe I spent quite a bit MORE time standing around waiting .
<en=7>I had wanted to split the total between a credit card and check card since I was being reimbursed for the tire but was told this was n't possible .
<en=8>Once I actually got back in my car , it was dirty and had grease all over the steering wheel .
<en=9>OK , one bad experience ... fine .
<en=10>The following Friday , I returned with my car to go ahead and replace the other 3 tires , which were worn .
<en=11>I would not have gone back , but I could n't find the particular tire they 'd used in stock anywhere else .
<en=12>Once again , I waited for quite a bit before being attended to .
<en=13>I got the order completed , and then questioned the technician since it came out about $ 40 less than I expected .
<en=14>He said it was the same tire , and verified this , after checking both the actual tire on my car and my service papers from earlier in the week .
<en=15>However , when he printed out the service quote , I could see that it was NOT the correct tire , and was not even an appropriate tire for my car model .
<en=16>So I pointed this out to him , at which point he said they only had one of the correct tires in stock .
<en=17>Ok -- fine .
<en=18>So I got just my other rear tire replaced .
<en=19>They promised it 'd be done within an hour , so I waited in the lobby .
<en=20>Over two hours later ( and ten minutes before they closed ) my car was finally finished .
<en=21>A few minutes after I left , I was called and informed that " I " left my wheel lock ( which they should have left in the car ) .
<en=22>Of course , they would be closing in 5 minutes , so I would have to hurry up or get it the next day .
<en=23>Of course I could n't make it back in time ( and they apparently could not stay 5 extra minutes to wait for me ) .
<en=24>The next day , no one could find my wheel lock and that particular technician was not in .
<en=25>Of course , they could n't call him either to ask about it because apparently they do n't keep their employees ' phone numbers ( riiight ) , so I would have to return on Monday ( driving for 3 days now with no wheel lock should I get a flat ) .
<en=26>On Monday I called and again it was a big to - do to find anyone who knew anything about it .
<en=27>Supposedly they will be holding it for me this evening , but I 'm sure that will also be a huge ordeal .
<en=28>The employees at this Sear's are completely apathetic and there did n't seem to be any sort of management that I could see .
<en=29>I will never return there again ( and now have some serious doubts about the quality of work they actually performed on my car ) .
