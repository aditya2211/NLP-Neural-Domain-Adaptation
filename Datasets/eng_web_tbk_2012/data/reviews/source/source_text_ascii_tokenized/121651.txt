<en=1>We love our new roof !
<en=2>We would like to thank you for the roofing job you did on our home .
<en=3>Everything was done on a timely manner and things were cleaned and picked up every day when the crew was done .
<en=4>We also liked the way that Ray checked on the job every day .
<en=5>And when the job was done every thing was cleaned up and hauled off that same day .
<en=6>We would not hesitate to use Spears Roofing again .
<en=7>We have already recommended you to some of our friends !
