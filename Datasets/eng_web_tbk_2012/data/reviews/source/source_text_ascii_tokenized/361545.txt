<en=2>Outside of parking being at a premium , especially on discount days , The Laundry Tub is not filthy and it 's no smaller than any of a dozen laundromats I 've been in .
<en=3>Yes , there are bigger , but bigger is n't necessarily better .
<en=4>I availed myself of the wash 'n fold service , taking just about a year 's worth of dirty clothes in and getting back neatly folded , clean clothes in clear plastic bags ( I 'd originally brought them in , in six large yellow garbage bags ) .
