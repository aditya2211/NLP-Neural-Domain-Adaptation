<en=1>Wonderful Experience
<en=2>I had immense pain on a Sunday morning , with friends and family telling me that I would never find a Dentist on a Sunday .
<en=3>Dr. Taylor was not only available on a Sunday , but also was able to immediately take care of me .
<en=4>He was incredibly informative about the options I had , giving me opinions on different treatments to choose from .
<en=5>Coming from a person who hates the dentist in general , Dr. Taylor was the best !
<en=6>He really made the visit a pain free one with excellent service !
<en=7>I would recommend him to everyone !
