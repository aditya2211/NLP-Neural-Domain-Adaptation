<en=1>Not so great
<en=2>My husband just got a bike there as a gift he 's only had it a month .
<en=3>It 's a nice bike and it cost a lot of money .
<en=4>But just this week a peddle broke .
<en=5>He took it back and they would not honor a warranty and said it was his fault because of his shoes ??
<en=6>So they were going to charge him for new peddles and proceeded to put them on without even telling him the price .
<en=7>Which was very expensive .
<en=8>He asked for a different pair instead and they only gave him five dollars off ??
<en=9>Trek is not so great
