<en=1>Smoker s Haven
<en=2>Yeah , this complex is not very good .
<en=3>Our bathroom fan , one electric outlet and 2 leaky sinks have yet to be fixed .
<en=4>Both bathrooms look like they were flooded and the wood cabinets are thrashed at the bottom and they slapped some pieces of wood over to try to cover it up .
<en=5>And non-smokers beware !!!
<en=6>I think 90 percent of the tenants are smokers !
<en=7>If you do not smoke , do not move here .
<en=8>Our unit reeks of old cigarette smoke and it started to become apparent a few weeks after we moved in .
<en=9>You can not walk 5 feet without smelling that disgusting cigarette smoke and it blows right into the windows all day and all night .
