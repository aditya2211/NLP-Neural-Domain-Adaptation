<en=1>Wish this was in Saratoga --
<en=2>We were introduced to Bistro Tallulah by traveler - professional diner who happens to own the Adelphi Hotel and travels the world -- and residing in Paris , London , New York the rest of the year .
<en=3>SHE KNOWS GREAT FOOD AND DINING EXPERIENCES .
<en=4>She was dead on -- this restaurant was wonderful --- do not be put off by the one negative review on this page .
<en=5>I can tell you we were pleasantly surprised -- BT has taste memory and each time back the food was consistently delicious -- same dishes -- were consistent .
<en=6>Our friend is a world traveler and loves unpretentious dining experiences and inspired food .
<en=7>This chef knows what he is doing .
<en=8>Treat yourself and go -- you will go back !
<en=9>I am a business owner in downtown Saratoga Springs and wish this restaurant was in our town !
<en=10>The affordable rent makes it possible for an inspired chef to serve his high quality fare at affordable prices !
<en=11>Unlike Saratoga .
<en=12>I rrly seek the cehf out to introduce myself -- but the second time we went -- i made a point of asking our wait person to introduce my friend and myself to the chef to tell him just how good our meals were .
