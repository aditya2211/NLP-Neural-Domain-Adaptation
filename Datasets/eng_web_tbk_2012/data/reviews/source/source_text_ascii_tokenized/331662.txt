<en=1>Nice selection , very clean , friendly staff !
<en=2>Hot Iron has become a favorite of our family .
<en=3>Everyone can get the signature dish with ingredients and spices that they want and have the fun of watching it cook .
<en=4>The staff are very friendly and conscientious .
<en=5>They always ask if you have meat in your dish , ( for vegetarians like me ) , they scrub an area of the grill and use separate utensils to cook .
<en=6>They do n't just dump your ingredients on and cook either , but carefully separate meat to the hotter parts of the grill and still manage to keep the veggies from turning to mush .
<en=7>The selection of meats , veggies and sauces is awesome too !
<en=8>Every time we go they seem to have a different ingredient or two which keeps things interesting .
<en=9>Meats are kept VERY cold , seafood smells fresh and the serving bar is VERY clean .
<en=10>Prices are reasonable , ( Kid s meals are around 4.99 ) and Wednesday's they have discount dinner prices , I believe .
