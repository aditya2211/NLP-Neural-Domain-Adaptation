<en=1>UGH !!!
<en=2>Got some nice " freshly baked " fruit squares , a personal favorite of mine .
<en=3>Took a bite , it tasted odd .
<en=4>Flipped the square over and saw it riddled with green mold !!!!
<en=5>Ugh !!
<en=6>I called the store and the clerk giggled , and agreed that it was gross , but said it was not her problem .
<en=7>She also refused to get a manager .
<en=8>I left my number , or tried to anyway .
<en=9>Same clerk had considerable difficulty taking down a number .
<en=10>I 'll never go back there again
