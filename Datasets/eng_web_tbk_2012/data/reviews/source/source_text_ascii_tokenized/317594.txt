<en=1>Great Dude Cut !
<en=2>Great service , cool vibe , impeccable style .
<en=3>I 'm a guy with tricky hair so getting that right is job # 1 .
<en=4>After going through 5 other places I finally found Janice at Alta Moda .
<en=5>Not only was it a good cut but my wife and friends comment on my hair every time I leave ... saying it 's the best look I 've ever had .
<en=6>Either I suck at my own style or Janice is a genius .
<en=7>Looks like there 's a lot of talent in this place .
<en=8>Worth every penny .
