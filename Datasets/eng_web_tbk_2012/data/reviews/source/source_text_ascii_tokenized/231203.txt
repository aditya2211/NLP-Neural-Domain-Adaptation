<en=1>Okay , here 's the scoop .
<en=2>I 'm a regular at the HH .
<en=3>The food is excellent , the serivce is horrible .
<en=4>I think they 're still in the mindset from when it was only smokers sitting around and drinking ... not in any hurry .
<en=5>In my experience the food has been excellent ( for the most part ) .
<en=6>However , the bartenders / waitresses definately need to be re-trained ( if they ever had any to begin with ) and learn two things : only chat with customers when other customers are not impatiently waiting and to look around more often to see if people are waiting .
<en=7>In some cases the result is because of understaffing , in some cases the staff just does n't care / know better .
<en=8>They must also get something to keep take - out warm , so it 's not room temperature at best when you get it home .
<en=9>You just have to know what you 're getting into when you go .
<en=10>Nice local pub , excellent food ( especially wings ) , and do n't go if you have a limited amount of time .
