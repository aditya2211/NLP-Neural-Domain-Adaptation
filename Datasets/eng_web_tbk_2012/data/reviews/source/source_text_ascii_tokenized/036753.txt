<en=2>i made the mistake of buying from these thieves .
<en=3>I paid 2 k cash for a truck with a blown motor .
<en=4>Their so called mechanic said the engine was good and " There is nothing mechanicly wrong with this truck " .
<en=5>Well I think a blown engine falls under the catagory of mechanics right ?
<en=6>Anyway they jimmy rigged it so i could drive it home .
<en=7>The next day i took it to 2 auto shops and they both told me the same thing , engine is junk .
<en=8>I called and got the same runaround on hold and noone calls you back .
<en=9>From a moral standpoint , you guys are really gon na take 2,000 bucks from someone that needs that truck to work and support his family when you know it s just a piece of scrap metal ?
<en=10>If it lasted 1 month i could suck it up but 1 day ?
<en=11>Grimy work you guys do .
<en=12>Buy your kids somethin nice with my 2 k bucks .
