<en=1>After recently relocating to South Bend , we were looking for a delicious , fun , yet elegant establishment for New Year s Eve dinner .
<en=2>We were disappointed with this holiday dinner due to the overall flavor and price of the meal , and accessibility to the Jazz Club .
<en=3>The meal was extremely overpriced and lacked flavor , especially for being a special NYE menu .
<en=4>The limited menu had few appetizing options and the NYE special packages were way overpriced .
<en=5>After our meal , our server found us a table in the jazz club where we were informed it would be another $ 10 / person to stay and listen to the band , despite the fact we had just finished a dinner there and were intending to enjoy their drink list .
<en=6>This was a less than impressive experience at Trio 's .
