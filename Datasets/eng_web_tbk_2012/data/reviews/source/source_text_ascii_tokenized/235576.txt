<en=1>The Best Breakfast in Solana Beach !
<en=2>We love T 's Cafe !
<en=3>Without a doubt the best place to grab a tall bloody mary and some eggs benedict .
<en=4>T 's has been a North County landmark for thirty years and with good reason .
<en=5>Family owned and operated makes sure the atmosphere is relaxed and the food home - cooked with style .
<en=6>I highly recommend picking up a jug of their homemade bloody mary mix - definitely the best .
<en=7>If you 've been to North County , chances are it 's in your favorites list already .
