<en=1>I interviewed several contractors for a kitchen remodel .
<en=2>Liberty construction shows up and it 's two guys ... all I get is 100 % sales pitch " We 're the best ... we 're number 50 so we must be doing something right ... look at all these certificates that say we 're great " .
<en=3>Not once did I feel listened to like they actually cared about what I wanted , all they were interested in was me signing a contract right then and there .
<en=4>Very high pressured sales and with the reviews of many others bad service .
<en=5>I 'm glad I trusted my gut and did n't get sucked into doing business with them .
<en=6>Find someone you trust that actually hears you and wants to do the job right .
