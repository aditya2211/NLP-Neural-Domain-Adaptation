<en=1>I just like the fact that he was able to do the specific type of repair I wanted ( a reball ) and give me the longest warranty and even a lower price .
<en=2>Someone else I found that said they could do it but wanted to charge me more and give me less warranty .

<en=4>I choose Console Pros and I 'm happy I did .
