<en=1>BEST PLACE IN AMES
<en=2>I lived here for two years when the prices were a little lower :) The places are very nice and clean , and in great condition !
<en=3>I really enjoyed the staff at Wessex , also the manager Sherri was always very nice and helpful .
<en=4>The fitness center was GREAT !
<en=5>The only problem that I had in 2 years of living there was that the walls are pretty thin , sometimes I could here my neighbors conversations .
<en=6>I would recommend these apartments to anybody !
<en=7>I absolutely LOVED living there .
