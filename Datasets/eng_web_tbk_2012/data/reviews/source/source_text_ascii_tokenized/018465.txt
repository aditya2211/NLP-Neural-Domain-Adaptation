<en=1>The Salon Experience from Hell
<en=2>I feel obligated to share this story .
<en=3>Right out of college I called the salon and explained my situation .
<en=4>Just graduated , just moved , not rich , and starting new job soon .
<en=5>I never got a price quote over the phone and they take your cc info just to make the appointment because if you do n't show up , they 'll charge you .
<en=6>I had this ridiculous celebrity stylist from LA named Derrick .
<en=7>After he already put product on my hair he said " I should warn you , I 'm expensive . "
<en=8>What was I supposed to do , say I ca n't afford you and walk out with crap all over my hair .
<en=9>I wanted to be very blonde and instead he pulled my root color throughout my whole hair which is a gross mousey brown .
<en=10>The other stylists around me kept pressuring me saying he 's so wonderful , you 're going to love your hair .
<en=11>$ 400 later my jaw dropped when the receptionist told me the total .
<en=12>Derrick did a terrible job , was a complete jerk the entire time , and I had no warning as to the price .
<en=13>I cried the entire way home .
<en=14>He then " fixed " it for free but it still looked like crap .
<en=15>I will never go back .
<en=16>It was the salon experience from absolutely Hell .
<en=17>He also told me that he worked on the cast of will and grace and that they were all jerks .
<en=18>That 's my favorite show of all time .
<en=19>I 'm pretty sure for the cast that it was the other way around .
<en=20>Maybe he did n't do a good job and they told him so .
<en=21>Absolute Nightmare !
<en=22>STAY AWAY !
