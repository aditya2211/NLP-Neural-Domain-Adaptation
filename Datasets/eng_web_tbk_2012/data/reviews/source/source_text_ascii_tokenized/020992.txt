<en=1>Do n't Expect Sleep or Courtesy
<en=2>I was booked for 2 nights at this hotel in Oct 2007 .
<en=3>At 3:15 am on night # 2 , the fire alarm and strobe light activated in my room .
<en=4>These are not household type alarms .
<en=5>When they sound off , it is a true audio / visual experience .
<en=6>I called the front desk and got no answer .
<en=7>After checking for signs of fire or smoke and seeing none , I decided to just pack up and leave .
<en=8>The desk agent actually argued with me , claiming that no such alarm had gone off ( as if I would make that up ? ) .
<en=9>He finally admitted that only the 4 ADA room alarms had sounded , so only 4 guests were effected ( no big deal to him ) .
<en=10>This little drip offered no apologies whatsoever , and even refused to give me the name of the manager until I pressed him for it 3 times .
<en=11>This hotel is adequate enough , but there is an obvious problem with the staff and management .
<en=12>Do not go there if you expect to sleep through the night .
