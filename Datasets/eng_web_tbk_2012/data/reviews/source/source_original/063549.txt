Best food in northeast

Theres a reason why Frank mcclelland was named best chef of the north east reigon. Food here is absolutely superb. Everything is delicous and cooked perfectly. The waiting staff is beyond impeccable (they refold your napkin when you go to the bathroom). If you want great food then L'espalier is the place to go.
