The BEST

Dr. Aster and her team have been a strong advocate in the health of both my daughters. Dr. Aster is very kind an gentle with the children, but also positive and to the point with the parents. She is and excellent doctor to have on one's team. Even though I live pretty far from her office I still make the trip so my daughters will have the BEST!
