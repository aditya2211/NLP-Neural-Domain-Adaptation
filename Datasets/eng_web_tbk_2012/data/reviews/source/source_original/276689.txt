The landlord is not nice nor helpful

I have lived in Buckingham Condominiums townhouse for 2 years. I love the location and the apartment!! I'ma single female and I feel safe coming home at night. The maintenance people are AWESOME!!!! And the exterminator is very nice, also. Yes, you still have a few bugs, but that's going to be anywhere you go! The only problem that I have experienced is the landlord. She is a pure b****!!! I know that's ugly...but she won't help you out for anything...sad story. Other than that, I would recommend living here. :)
