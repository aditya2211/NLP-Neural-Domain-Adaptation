Great, and probably the only West Indian spot worth hitting up in Nashville.

I was born and raised in Toronto, which has a huge West Indian (Trinidadian, Jamaican, etc) population. So huge in fact, that Toronto slang is influenced by and has Jamaican references, and Jamaican beef patties are staples in my high school cafeteria. Anyway, I was practically raised on this stuff, and being a connoisseur of West Indian cuisine, Jamaica Way is a bit toned down to suit the American palette. All you have to do to make it authentic Jamaican food, is add a whole lot of pepper. Alot.
