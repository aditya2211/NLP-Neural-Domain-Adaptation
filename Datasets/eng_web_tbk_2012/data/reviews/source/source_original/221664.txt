This place is a Rip-Off

I brought a car in to have the "check engine" light diagnosed back in March of 2010. They said it was "plugs and wires" and quoted me $330 to do the work, including parts. I asked why so high and they said it was due to the labor of moving things out of the way. Those things ended up being a windsheild washer fluid tank (1 screw) and the air filter canister (4 spring clips). I did the work myself for $50. There's no excuse for that kind of estimate.
