Cathy ******Five Stars for Lake Forest Tots. The program has been a postive experience for my children. I have had all three of my children attend Lake Forest Tots. The program is well established and we have been extremely satisfied with the teachers, the programs and the director. Good job, Lake Forest Tots!
