The staff leaves a lot to be desired. The front staff has seen quite a bit of turnover and changed from professional to rude. A simple follow-up phone call with a woman quickly turned into a nightmare. She may be the reason for all the change. I sincerely wonder if the doctor has a clue about what is going on within his practice. If he does know and approves of this behavior then it is a poor reflection on him. Sometimes it is not worth it to go through that kind of staff and their personal attitude to get to a doctor. He was an okay doctor but not worth her.
