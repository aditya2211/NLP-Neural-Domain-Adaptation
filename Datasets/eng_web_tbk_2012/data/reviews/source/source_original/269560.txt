Was there this past weekend and the guy behind the counter yelled at me and my son because we believed he left the grandma slice in the oven a little too long and the cheese got all dried out and the slice tasted more like a cracker. He preceded to grab the slice off the countertop and throw it into the trash while yelling at me saying, "you do not order what you do not know about" and "you don't know how pizza is made". It was very upsetting to see this kind of behavior especially in front of my four year old. He was in the process of making me a pie and when I got home, the pie was the worst I have ever seen. Cheese was falling off, so oily and greasy. I think he did it on purpose because of my simple request for another slice of grandma that wasn't so well-done (actually, burnt). I will never go back to this place and I am reporting them to the better business bureau for such horrible customer relations and basically sabotaging my pizza and taking my $25. THIS STORY IS 100% TRUE. That little man who thinks he invented pizza can kiss my *ss.
