Great Job

I want to say that Mike did a great job for our family in our time of need. Both my grandparents passed away 4 months apart and Mike was very understanding. It was a very trying time for my family and myself yet Mike took the time to greet each and everyone one of us. He is very professional in his position as a director and yet he still made time to be compassionate for what we were all going through. I'm sure its not everyday that a funeral director sees the same family in such a short time. My grandfather passed away silently in his sleep, and my grandmother passed away after a short struggle with cancer. Both my grandparents looked as natural as could be expected. Thank you Mike for all your help professionally and personally. The Peterson Family
