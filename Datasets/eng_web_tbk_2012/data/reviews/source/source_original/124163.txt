Cranmore Dental and Implant Clinic : I could not recommend Dr David Nelson enough. I had a severe phobia of attending the dentist until I met and was treated by Dr Nelson. He instantaneously put me at ease and his ongoing treatments have been absolutely pain free. My previous apprehension has been dismissed and I no longer have a sinking feeling when my next appointment is due! In addition to the core treatment, Dr Nelson has impressed me further with his concern and interest in the well-being of his patients – his dental work underpinned by a strong duty of care to every patient. He is always prepared to go the extra mile to ensure that any patient discomfort is dealt with immediately – Pam Gillies
