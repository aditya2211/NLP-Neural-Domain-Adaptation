Overpriced

This place is identical to the Youngstown Sports Grille, so I imagine they are owned/operated by the same people. The food is mediocre at best, and largely overpriced given the portion size and quality. Don't even get me started on how expensive it is to drink there. I have ate here 3 times since they first opened, and the service has been poor each time, the staff always comes across as somewhat rude and slow.
