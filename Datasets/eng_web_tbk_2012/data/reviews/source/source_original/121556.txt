Holly is truely the best hairstylist!

I have lived in the UTC La Jolla area for many years, and I never new this salon was here until a friend reffered me to see Holly here. I was very pleased with my experience here. All of the people were friendly and welcoming. I got highlights, haircut, and a blowdry. She did a great job! Holly is very experienced and talented, and I could tell she new what she was doing right off the bat. My hair looks amazing, and I get compliments all the time. I deffenitly reccomend this salon and Holly to anyone. You will not be disappointed!!!!!!
