Great Food Awesome food Awesome service

I wanted to try someplace new again. This place rocked. Brought my wife Deb with me and she like the Fried Crab Wontons and said they were good.. We also had the BBQ Spare Ribs.. good also. I ordered the MOO SHU pork and it was great.. I also ordered the Neptune Platter which was awesome... so this place gets 5 out of 5 stars.
