Top notch eats!

So here we are in Manson. Manson? Yes, Manson. Right near Chelan. Aka Nowheresville. And this litttle gem of a 7-table restaurant is a complete and utterly wonderful surprise. A short but wide-ranging menu executed with innovative perfection in a cozy hole in the wall just off the main street. Fantastic food served without pretense, very reasonably priced wine selections. A great place to go for dinner after a day of wine tasting.
