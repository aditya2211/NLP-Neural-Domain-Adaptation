Great out night! You can't go wrong with Tuesday prices, even if you get quite the mixed bag of comedians! Extensive drink list and daily specials but wish they had a bit more on their food menu, although popcorn is a nice touch! (other items: chicken fingers, wings, asian pizza, and yam and regular fries)
