The Salon Experience from Hell

I feel obligated to share this story. Right out of college I called the salon and explained my situation. Just graduated, just moved, not rich, and starting new job soon. I never got a price quote over the phone and they take your cc info just to make the appointment because if you don't show up, they'll charge you. I had this ridiculous celebrity stylist from LA named Derrick. After he already put product on my hair he said "I should warn you, I'm expensive." What was I supposed to do, say I can't afford you and walk out with crap all over my hair. I wanted to be very blonde and instead he pulled my root color throughout my whole hair which is a gross mousey brown. The other stylists around me kept pressuring me saying he's so wonderful, you're going to love your hair. $400 later my jaw dropped when the receptionist told me the total. Derrick did a terrible job, was a complete jerk the entire time, and I had no warning as to the price. I cried the entire way home. He then "fixed" it for free but it still looked like crap. I will never go back. It was the salon experience from absolutely Hell. He also told me that he worked on the cast of will and grace and that they were all jerks. That's my favorite show of all time. I'm pretty sure for the cast that it was the other way around. Maybe he didn't do a good job and they told him so. Absolute Nightmare! STAY AWAY!
