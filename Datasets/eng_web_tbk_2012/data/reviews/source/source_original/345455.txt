First Time Ballerina

My daughter is starting ballet this year for the first time. I'ma soccer mom so I wasn't sure what I was looking for when it comes to dancewear. The staff was very helpful and gave me exactly what I needed for my first time ballerina. The service at Instep was great!! I would recommend them to anyone!
