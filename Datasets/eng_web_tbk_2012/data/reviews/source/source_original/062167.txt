Highly Recommend

I work as a Transformational Life Coach. Since this is an alternative therapy I always refer clients to a lisenced therapist when I feel that is appropriate. I found her through a colleague one day when one of my clients was in the midst of a panic attack and needed professional help that I am not qualified to provide. Little did I know that I would soon be needing her help as well! She guided me through a very difficult period dealing with a family member's suicide, coupled with elder abuse. I found her to be extremely solid, kind, compassionate, and intuitive as well. I would recommend her highly!
