Skylight repair

My skylight was making a horrible noise when the wind blew. James Bateman came the day I called and fixed the problem quickly and efficiently. He also inspected my entie roof to see if there was anything else that needed attention. He called the next day to see if everything was to my satisfaction. When the next hailstorm blows through, I will not hesitate to contact James at Team Texas Construction.
