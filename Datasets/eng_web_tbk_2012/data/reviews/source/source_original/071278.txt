WOW!!! I can't say enough good things about Karla and the wonderful things she has done for me and my dog Gracee. Gracee is more excited to see her than she is to see me!!!! She has always been there for Gracee even for last minute calls! She has taken care of my sweet girl for almost 4 years now and I would not let Gracee go with anyone besides her!!! She is caring, punctual, and very enthusiastic about her job! You should give her a try - it's worth every penny to know that you pet is in GREAT hands with Wunderbar pet sitting!!!!
