There are so many wonderful great places to dine in houston....don't.waste your time here. I had the morelias enchiladas. The sauce was dry and the enchiladas did not taste good.at all. In fact my friend vomited after our meal. Maybe we ordered the wrong dish but my experience here was poor. Service was okay not great, we came for a late lunch. I don't recommend this place.
