Review on House of Joy Chinese Restaurant

My family and I moved to San Antonio a year ago and have tried almost all of the Chinese Restaurants because we love Chinese food. Well it took us a while to find one that we liked. But we don't just like House of Joy WE LOVE IT. Everything we have gotten there has been more authentic and better tasting than any other Chinese restaurant in the San Antonio area we have been to--and trust me we have been to a lot of them. We just happen to stumble across this little restaurant one day when we had to visit the Bexar County Tax Office off of Bandera Road. We stopped in and got some take out and cannot stop going back. They have the best Egg Drop Soup I have ever tasted. We also love their Egg Rolls and Spring Rolls. And every entree we have ordered is perfect. Everything is always cooked fresh and tastes fresh. Their prices are extremely reasonable for the amount of food you receive. The staff is also just so pleasant to deal with. They are also quick at getting your order out to you. You don't have to sit and wait around forever like most places!! So anyone looking for an Excellent night out for Chinese or maybe just lunch should stop in and try it because I promise you 2 things---You won't regret it!! and you will go back for more!!! Karla Ferguson-Granger PS I have noticed on here that someone left a comment that "all of the nice comments must come from co workers or friends" and I will tell you that I don't know these people except from eating at their restaurant. We are from Virginia and just moved here a year ago. So that comment is completely false. Because we think IT'S THE BEST!!! and we don't know them except for eating there.
