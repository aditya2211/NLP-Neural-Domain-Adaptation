great service/deals - support this local business

I have used these guys for new snows, fixing lots of flats, used replacement tires, and oil changes. They have the best prices locally and good customer service. One guy is a little surley, but who gives a crap as long as your car's work is outstanding. AND they're usually able to help you as a walk-in, and they're fast. Overall-good stuff.
