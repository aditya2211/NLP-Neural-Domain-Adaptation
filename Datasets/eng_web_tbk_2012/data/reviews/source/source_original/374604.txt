I've never felt the need to write a review or make a complaint before, but after the way I was spoken to by a member of staff at the kennels (whose name I believe to be Mrs Closs) I would now not recommend this business to anybody. If the animals are treated in the same way the customers are treated then this leaves a lot to be desired! Nobody should be spoken to like that regardless of how bad their day may have been or what may be going on in their private lives!
