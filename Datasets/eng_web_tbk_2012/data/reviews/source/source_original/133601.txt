Dr. Chao you are the best dentist I have ever had. You are knowledgeable, professional, gentel and kind. I wish I had you as my dentist early on in my life - maybe my teeth would have been a lot better then they are now, However I am glad you are my dentist now. Even though you are expensive. Thank you for helping to preserve my teeth. You are meticulous in your work and it shows in my smile.
