Make You Feel Like a Number

Stay away from Kids First West Chester. You NEVER get a human on the phone. It's impossible to get an appointment. If you get caught in traffic and are a couple minutes late they make you re-schedule... for 6 weeks later. And worst of all your child feels like a number not a patient. Go somewhere else.
