Wonderful Experience

I had immense pain on a Sunday morning, with friends and family telling me that I would never find a Dentist on a Sunday. Dr. Taylor was not only available on a Sunday, but also was able to immediately take care of me. He was incredibly informative about the options I had, giving me opinions on different treatments to choose from. Coming from a person who hates the dentist in general, Dr. Taylor was the best! He really made the visit a pain free one with excellent service! I would recommend him to everyone!
