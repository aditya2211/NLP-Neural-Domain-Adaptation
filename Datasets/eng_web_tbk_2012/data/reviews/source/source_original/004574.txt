Over-rated...

This restaurant is over-rated. It is hard to find...and the mexican food is bland, almost equivalent to eating out of a can. The service is poor...I asked for a fried egg on my enchiladas...and did not get it.! Secondly, the enchladas did not come with enchilada sauce..but chili...like Hormel's chili..the cheese was American cheese! The Chili Relleno..had no batter on it.
