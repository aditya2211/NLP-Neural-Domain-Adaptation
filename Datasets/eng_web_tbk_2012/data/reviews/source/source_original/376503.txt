I interviewed several contractors for a kitchen remodel. Liberty construction shows up and it's two guys...all I get is 100% sales pitch "We're the best...we're number 50 so we must be doing something right...look at all these certificates that say we're great". Not once did I feel listened to like they actually cared about what I wanted, all they were interested in was me signing a contract right then and there. Very high pressured sales and with the reviews of many others bad service. I'm glad I trusted my gut and didn't get sucked into doing business with them. Find someone you trust that actually hears you and wants to do the job right.
