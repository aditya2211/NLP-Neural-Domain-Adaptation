My Favorite in McLean

My family loves coming to Endo Sushi.They are very nice, it is never crowded, and the food is wonderful, very delicious and fresh! Sometimes it is hard to get parking in the lot in front of the storefront, and it is on a one-way street, but the restaurant itself is NEVER overcrowded. If you cannot park in the lot, then you can park in the shopping center's garage, and walk up to Endo Sushi. The service is fast. Be sure to ring the little bell on your way out if you enjoyed your meal! (it's by the door, on the hostess stand)
