DO NOT GO HERE!!! I went to get my nails filled Friday, by Monday 2 were broken. I was not happy with the way they looked, very wavy, uneven edges, and with the exception of 1, there is a dip in the center of each nail. I also had a pedicure, and they cut my nails too short, one of my big toes looks like its getting infected.
