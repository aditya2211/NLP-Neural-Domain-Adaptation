Watch out for your wallet

Watch out for your wallet! This company is overpriced for their services. They pride themselves on being an event and team building company for corporate clients but you better believe they are going to mark you up on that feel good premise. On a recent event quote that I had done, they came in thousands of dollars over their local competition. The craziest part is that they aren't even based locally at the city I'm in- they just have 'teams' in areas through the country. I've spoken to vendors who are used by them who had nothing good to say about the company as well and in fact were afraid to quote events against them even though they openly admitted that they felt Canadian Outback was pricing their entertainment out of the market and doing more to hurt their business than help them. Be warned- they'll ltake you for everything they can.
