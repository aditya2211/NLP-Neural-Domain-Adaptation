Not what i expected!

We read the good reviews before going and had high hopes.. but to our dismay it didnt turn out that way! ~It took over 40 mins to be taken to our table, once there it took another 20 mins to get our orders and a further 45 mins till our starters landed on our table. Very frustrating for a restaurant that has 1 rosette and is supposedly renowned for the service... hmm There was no canape's or amuse to keep us occupied, once we complained about the wait they took us something to nibble on but that took us getting out our chairs and wondering round to do that and it was impossible to get anyones attention. Scallops were overcooked and the foie gras was cold but the rest of the food was lovely. On top of that though they tried to charge us service charge just to rub it it.... Wouldn't go back as there are a lot of places A LOT better and cheaper.
