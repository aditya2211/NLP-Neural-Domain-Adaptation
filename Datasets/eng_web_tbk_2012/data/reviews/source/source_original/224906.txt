First and Last time we'll eat there

My friend and I went there for lunch today. Neither one of us had ever been - so we thought we'd try it. BIG MISTAKE - The food was tasteless and cold. We both kept trying to find something we liked. The only thing I found edible were the potato wedges, I finally gave up, he kept trying - he found the fried wantons to be OK - His Mongolian bowl was awful. Would NOT recommend this place to anyone - in fact - save your money and go somewhere else.
