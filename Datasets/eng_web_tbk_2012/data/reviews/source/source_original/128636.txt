David is amazing

David is the most helpful and creative photographer that I have used. He is willing to do whatever you need from him without hesitation. He was patient and adapted when everything didn't go according to schedule on my wedding day. Both the engagement and wedding pictures that he took for us we absolutely amazing. He got the pictures back to me quickly. I would highly recommend David to anyone. He will exceed your expectations! He doesn't just take pictures he makes art out of them and you won't even notice that there's a camera there.
