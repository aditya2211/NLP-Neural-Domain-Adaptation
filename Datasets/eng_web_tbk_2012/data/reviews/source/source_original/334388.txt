No way.

I'm certainly no expert on asian food in fact not even a lover of Vietnamese food but I wanted to try the real things here at A Dong. Cold, slimy, tasteless however is the same in all languages and foods. Not good, not great, and again another disappointment in Central Iowa. How do these places stay in business. This town needs some food soul and this is not it.
