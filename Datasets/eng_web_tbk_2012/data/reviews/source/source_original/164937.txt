Super nice people, really good food

What I love most about this place, other than the food, is that eating here makes you feel like you're in a small town rather than Baltimore. The owners are really nice, they serve good food at a good price, and the option to eat outside on the deck (esp on the weekend whether there is hardly any traffic) is great. One of my top 5 places to eat in Baltimore.
