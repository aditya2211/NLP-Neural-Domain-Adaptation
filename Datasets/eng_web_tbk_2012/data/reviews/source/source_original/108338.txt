The internet here is terrible. Like the previous poster said, the com lines are split between the entire building. That's 3x worse than Qwest DSL's lowest speed offering! The outward appearance makes you think this place is nice, but everything inside is cheap cheap cheap. Moving out as soon as our lease is up. http://www.speedtest.net/result/1155244347.png
