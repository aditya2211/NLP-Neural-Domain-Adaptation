Great

This is a perfect place to get your hair done. I have gone there time and time again whenever I need to get my hair done or when I want a haircut. When I get my hair done there, they use enough hairstyling products while it does not ruin your hair. The service is great and during weekends it tends to get busy, but the wait is worthwhile.
