They Suck

Go somewhere else... Wanted to buy a Rhino 700 and a Grizzly 700. After searching high and low for a salesman, I was treated like dirt, and we left. Parts department blows, Service department is even worse. I live 10 minutes from Cycle City, but I Drove 50 mile south to Peachstate Powersports in LaGrange, dealt with the owner, Levi, and was well taken care of.
