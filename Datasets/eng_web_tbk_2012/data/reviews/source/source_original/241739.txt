Great Barber

Firstly, the other reviewer clearly has never been to Nick's, or he would know that Nick only charges $13 for a haircut which is pretty much industry standard. I have been going to Nick for 5 months now precisely because he does pay attention to detail. I have terrible hair and he really takes his time to make it look right. Some of the younger kids that work there are a bit sub par, but if you wait for Nick... you'll be good.
