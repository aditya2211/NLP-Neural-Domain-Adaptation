Highly Recommended

We walked in to pick our little man at 10 minutes to closing and heard laughter from kids and the staff. The facilities are more than adequate and the staff are just phenomenal. Their sense of humour and calmness when dealing with the little ones amazes me every time I walk in. We have since moved slightly further away from the centre but it's worth the extra travel, as the care provided exceeds our expectations... especially after a few horrendous daycare experiences elsewhere.
