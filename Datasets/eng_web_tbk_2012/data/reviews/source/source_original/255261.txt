Rate a church? Might as well just hotpot the curb and rate the traffic light. It's a bloody church, for chrisssake! Big, grey and imposing. Go there on christian holidays for a bit of churchy grandure. The pastor at this church is cool, I met him after some holiday service. He had a robe that was made back in the '60s. God was pleased with that one! It's historical for Sf, so when your aunte comes for a visit, take her there. Great for the kiddies - they love the labyrinth (don't forget to tell 'em its really a 'pagen' thing!). Stop by at least once or you'll go to heck!
