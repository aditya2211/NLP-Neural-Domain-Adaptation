The Best Deals in Town

Before you buy ANYTHING in NY, make sure you stop by Jack-s first. Their selection is random, so what they have on a given week might never be available again at the store. I love it for discounted beauty items and household appliances. Trust me, you go there once and you-ll always go back!
