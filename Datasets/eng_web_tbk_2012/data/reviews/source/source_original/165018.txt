Run for the hills ... you'll be much better off!

One night was too much. First room had used tissues next to the bed and I requested it be rectified. I was then moved to another room around the back where the room was dirty, the shower was dirty with other peoples hair in it, the toilet seat was peeling and rough and the bathroom was full of mould. I called reception to ask if they knew the state the room was in and was told "This is a Days Inn, not the Hilton" and the receptionist then hung up on me. To warn you to stay away from this place just isn't enough. There was not one ounce of caring involved and anyone I can warn about the complete lack of service will be warned.
