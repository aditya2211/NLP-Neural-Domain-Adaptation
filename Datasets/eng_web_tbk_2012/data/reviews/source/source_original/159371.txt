ok but just becuse we where on a tight budget.

me and my dad where in NJ for a kc chiefs(my home team)vs the NY jets and for game 4 of the world series.i'ma red sox fan so i was glad that the phillies won.the knights inn was small very small.i mean 1 room in every room!it was cozy a little and a small tv.i mean a 2 day stay was a ok stay even tho the manager looked like he was chineze and that we only slept and went out from 8 to 7 to see New York.but sice we almost just slept there i cant give that good of a review
