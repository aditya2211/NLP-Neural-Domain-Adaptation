BEST CHINESE RESTAURANT EVER!!!

It was the best Chinese food I have ever had. All the food tasted excellent, and with the new renovation of chairs and the bathroom, it is awesome. The people working their are also extremely polite and friendly. Every time I go, Kevin, the manager, will always remember my family and I. Overall, it is very family oriented, and I recommend it to everyone!!!
