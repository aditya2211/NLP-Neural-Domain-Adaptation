Trust The Midas Touch

I personally trust this Midas store with all my vehicles, I have been going there for years & would never go anywhere else! the staff is very personable & actually care about the customers safety rather than taking there money. This is however a very busy shop but there are appointments available & the staff up front will surely make sure you get back in a timely manner. I look at some of these other comments & laugh because people think that the world revolves around them! Like the girl with the fuse problem...Midas has the most high tech equipment in town & I guarantee you if they told you it was electrical then in deed its electrical! maybe you should understand how the world works & realize you are just like any other person & not put yourself on a pedestal. I will continue going to Dave at Midas because he is one of the most honest business owners in this town! When having your car worked on you have to trust the mechanic & this Midas is truly someone you can trust!
