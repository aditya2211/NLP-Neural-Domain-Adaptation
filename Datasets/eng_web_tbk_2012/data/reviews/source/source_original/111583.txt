All I can say is that I am glad I went in! The nurses are sweet as pie and the doctor is wonderful. This place is about healing, not making a buck.The followup visit is FREE!! After going to the hospital and paying ER prices ... there is no way I won't be back here!! I will be back and telling EVERYONE about this clinic. THANK YOU!!
