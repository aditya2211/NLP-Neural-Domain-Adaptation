I would NEVER recommend this gym to anyone and unfortunately this is based solely on the owner's own unprofessionalism. When I originally joined in January I only did so because I was told I would be able to cancel the 12 month membership if I was to move away. I signed up with one of the staff who was very pleasant and professional. Actually working out there was good - the machines are nice and the classes are fun. The locker room is certainly lacking - I would never shower or change there. They need to update the locker rooms ASAP. Back to my poor rating - I was excepted to medical school and went in to cancel my membership as I was told I could do since I was moving away. The owner was VERY rude, accused me of not reading my contract, and basically told me to shut up when I was trying to ask questions to further understand the process of canceling my membership. I was able to cancel it but only after paying a $50 fee (which the staff person who signed me up stated I would not have to pay if I had proof of moving) and being spoken to in a very belittling manner. I would understand if I was being treated this way by a staff member but the club's actual OWNER?! Bad for business. I was appalled. I will never recommend this gym to any woman. The equipment and classes aren't good enough to deal with the rudeness from the staff!!! There are better places on the Cape - FITNESS 500!
