Disappointed

The Bad: I was at Napa recently and was unpleasantly surprised at poor waiter svce and subpar food. We were a party of 4 and none of us were particularly pleased with our dishes. Napa is all about wine but gives very short descriptions of the wines on their lists. I found my initial selection satisfactory but the wine flight we chose to be poorly composed. If you must go ask lots of questions about your selections since your expectations may as high as mine were.
