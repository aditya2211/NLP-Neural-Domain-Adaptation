Can't wait to go back!!!

This is by far the BEST B&B that we have ever stayed at! We were in Santa Fe for a special event and our hosts rented out the El Paradero for all their guests to stay at. We could not have been more welcomed, more comfortable or more well fed. The weekend was perfect in every way, in large part to Sue and her great staff. Everyone was so friendly and really went out of their way to make sure everything went well. We can not wait to go back to Santa Fe and to this great B&B...especially my 4 year old, who made friends with Ms. Sue and all the ladies, and has talked about them since we left! We would highly recommend the El Paradero on your next trip to Santa Fe!
