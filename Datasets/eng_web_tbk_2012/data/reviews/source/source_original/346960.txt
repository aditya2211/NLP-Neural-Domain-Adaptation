Excellent customer service and quality work. They went the extra mile to repair my cowboy boots-- they had to have a special kind of paper that looked like wood grain to fix the heels. That was 4 years ago. I haven't been able to find a shoe repair place in Seattle since that has been able to do it. (I've been through at least 5 places already.) If I had time to drive to Tacoma before they closed during the work week, I would just so I could get those boots fixed properly again.
