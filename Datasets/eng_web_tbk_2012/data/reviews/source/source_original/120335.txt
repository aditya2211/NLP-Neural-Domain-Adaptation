You can fool people

This store is proof that you can fool people with good advertising. They convince lots of people that they are a great store, when in fact they are a very average place at best, they are just another big box store like the others. They offer sales that aren't really sales, mislabeled items that make the item sound like a good deal when it isn't, a bad attitude about return items, and on and on. With higher than average prices to boot! So don't get taken in, keep your eyes open if you choose to shop here. On the other hand, the Richmond Ukrops chain is known for its charity work, its community action, and its interest in the public welfare.
