I stopped in today @ Yards Brewery. I must say, I was impressed with the size of the bar area and lounge, & I liked that you could see the brewery right thru the glass! I had a sampler of IPA, Brawler, Love Stout & ESA. All were awesome, & I had a Dogwood Grilled Cheese which was enjoyable with the fine beers. After my sampler & sandwich, I asked for a pint of there Nitrogen Love Stout, I must say I was impressed, with the great taste & I am a Guiness Lover so coming from me, I think this is better, its less dry & smoother! If you are in Philly you have to come check this place out! The only negative I have abou this place is the parking! I left with a case of BRAWLER!!!!!
