Poor service

If you like the drama described in popular sitcom 'Seinfeld', you will see it here. We signed our name in about 6:00pm. There were 3 names before us. The greeter said there was about 15 minutes waiting. However, we waited and waited and in the mean time, saw 4 groups of people simply just paraded in without signing there names. This sign in policy is posted by the restaurant “no reservation, sign your name here”. I had to ask the greeter, he explained his reasons with broken English. I could not understand any his reasons. I could only take it as they would seat the people they know first. My conclusion is that you should only go there if you want to wait a least an hour and see all kinds other people being seated before you.
