Best Store In Boothbay Harbor

What a fantastic store, I love this place. Not the same old stuff that all the other stores have. Their items are very unique, great quality, great prices. They also have the best tea I ever had, not at all like the junk you get at the grocery stores, I stock up when ever there because they are closed in the winter.
