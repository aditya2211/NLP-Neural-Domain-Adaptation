Great Surgeon

I needed wisdom teeth taken out. Dr. Wallen and staff was excellent. They were accomdating with my scheduled and work with my insurance to get payment for the surgery. Dr. Wallen explained the procedure in detail and took his time with me. Staff explained insurance procedures and was very helpful. Everyone was very nice.
