Hams on Friendly ... RIP

This is the original Ham's restaurant, expanded into a regional chain in the late 80's -- but this one is no more. Victim of hard times and I suspect failing corporate management. According to news accounts, the company is struggling. I have many fond memories of my college evenings there long ago. So long Hams ... you will be missed.
