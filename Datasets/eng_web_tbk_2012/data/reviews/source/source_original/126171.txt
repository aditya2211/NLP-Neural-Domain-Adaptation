Only Concerned With Money

I have been getting my treatments for a few months now and have seen some results but not up to the standards that I was told I should expect. The people there attempt to come across and professional and nice, but I was disappointed with their customer service. Never miss an appointment because they will charge you the price of a treatment, even if you had an emergency. It's pretty ridiculous! They want to squeeze as much as they can from you even if you just got in a car accident!!!! They don't care one bit about you!!!!!
