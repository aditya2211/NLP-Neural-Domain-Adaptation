The finest Christmas Trees i've ever seen.

I felt like I was in heaven when I walked through the majestic fields of this particular farm. The trees were in magnificent shape and the variety was astounding. The owners were entertaining and gracious. I especially liked the Eco friendly atmosphere and the owners love of all animals. This is one of the best farms I have ever been too. I would call it the Taj Mahal of the east coast! It put hair on my chest and thanks to the owners advice I invested vanguard, got myself a woman like Jerry, and became a republican. Thanks Tussey Mountain Tree Plantation!
