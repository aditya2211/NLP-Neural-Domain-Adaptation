OMG

OMG.. make sure to book a reservation, as this magical place is packed (in a nice way) I love that the owner walks around and cares how his customers feel about their food. The waiters are like no other...My waiter was so excellent I gave him a 75% tip, and it was worht every penny.. The food was finger licking the bowel fantastic.. I just discovered her has a place right near my work ( Color me Phat) If you are looking for a romatic place with the best food and service in the valley Giovanni Ristorante should be your number 1 + 2 choice.
