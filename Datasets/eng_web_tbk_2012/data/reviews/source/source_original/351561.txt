Dumbest F'ers ever

I called dominos tonight, it rang forever, I get put on hold twice without saying a word and FINALLY someone says, MAY I HELP YOU? So I say: I'm at the Radison Warwick hotel in Rittenhouse Square (built in 1926) do you deliver to the Warwick? They say no, Warwick in New Jersey, Call New Jersey. I laugh and say, no, that Warwick is in New York, but I'm at the Radison-Warwick. And he says: You're at Warwick in Pennsylvania? and I said, YES, CENTER CITY PHILLY, and he says, NO, Warwick is a township, If you're at a Radison in Warwick thats too far, try dominos in Pottstown. I say, NO, I am at the RADISON WARWICK HOTEL in Rittenhouse Square. He says: I not know that town, I have to get to work, I'm in PHILLY. Call dominos in your town. I SAY LISTEN: I'm at 17th and LOCUST, do you deliver there? He says, I have to have an exact ADDRESS. OK, 1701 LOCUST STREET i say. he says: Why you tell me your in WARWICK TOWNSHIP? He gives the phone to a girl, she says, I have to have your address, I say, do you deliver to 17th and locust, she says, your exact address, I say 1-7-0-1 Locust, ARe you sure? she asks? YES I am sure, well, she says, is that ON 17th STREET. Yes, I say. 17th, like over by 16th and 15th YES, I say, one mile west of you. You're at 7th. I am just south of Walnut. She says, Is that 17th like over past broad. YES, I am west of broad. Broad, I say, is 14th street and I am 3 blocks west of broad and one south of walnut. Hmmm, she says, Then why are you calling here, we don't go past broad? Anyway, after much yelling and cussing I hung up, grabbed a cab, and went to Geno's.
