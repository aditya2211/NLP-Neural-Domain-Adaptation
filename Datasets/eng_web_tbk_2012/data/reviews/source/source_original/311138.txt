Consistantly poor

A lack of organisation, coupled with the distain for its customers, makes this the worst rental agency I have used. Chasing them on issues from the day I moved in (many of them still unresolved as I left) to all sorts of farcical issues with funds, after I left. . . . as soon as I could. If you must use them, be vigilant and be ready to push, if you can go elsewhere then I would.
