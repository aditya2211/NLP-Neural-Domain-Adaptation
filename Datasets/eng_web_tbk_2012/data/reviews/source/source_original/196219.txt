ATE HERE A COUPLE TIMES. IT IS NOT A HIGH END STEAK HOUSE, MORE OF THE CUISINE BRETT ENJOYS IN MISSISSIPPI. SO, IF YOU WANT A BURGER AND FRIES, WELL, IT IS OK. IF YOU WANT A LITTLE CAJUNISH FOOD - IT IS GOOD. IF YOU WANT A STEAK, WELL, THIS IS NOT THE BEST IN GREEN BAY. OVERALL DECENT BUT IF YOU ARE EXPECTING A RUTH CHRIS TYPE STEAK, THIS IS NOT IT.
