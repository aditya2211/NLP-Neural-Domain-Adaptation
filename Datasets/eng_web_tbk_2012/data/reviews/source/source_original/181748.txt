Be Careful Of Who Your Sales Guy Is

I think this place is probably really great especially judging by the reviews on here. My experience was awful though. It ALL had to do with the sales guy which was a young 22 year old who had admittedly only been working for 2 weeks. I was extremely interested in the car and very likely would have bought it, but the sales guy I dealt with ruined the deal. Essentially, I told him I didn't trust him cause he was a car salesman, but he got so incredibly offended at that statement that he had to go cry to another salesman and compose himself before coming back. I don't know if the kid had a bad day or what, but I had to sit and apologize about nothing for 10 minutes until he dropped the issue. After that, I just tried to ignore his lack of professionalism and test drive the car. I played dumb and asked him questions that I already knew the answers to and he responded with half truths and a few falsehoods. For instance I asked who owned Mazda and he said with confidence that was GM, which isn't true. I mean, I don't care if he doesn't know, but if he pretends to know and tells me BS to my face, there's no way I'm going to trust him when matters turn to the price of the car and financing.
