Poor Service, Lack of Passion: Do NOT go

I began seeing Dr. Romanick back in 2000 and have seen a significant decline in the quality of care, patient-doctor communication, and just the overall level of services. The poor quality starts at the receptionist desk, where the staff is very impatient and lack the efficiency I once loved about the office. It took them nearly two months to complete a simple task, and countless calls from my part due to their lack of response and passion (not that it's a requirement for the job, but it helps to at least pretend to be helpful). Also, I was promised to have my test results emailed to me, but it never happened, and after a few attempts to get Dr. Romanick on the phone to brief me on my condition, I finally gave up and went to a different doctor. Please do not go there if it's professional, friendly, diligent medical services you're looking for. Save yourself the trouble, money and time and visit a more caring facility/doctor.
