Long Lines, Silly Rules, Rude Staff, Ok Food

The first thing you notice when you arrive on location is that the waiting line literally goes out the door and spills into the parking lot. A restaurant with this many patrons willing to stand in line just to order tacos must be good, right? I mean, that's the way it works at amusement parks: the longest lines are at the best rides. Well, this may be an exception. The staff taking your order and "waiting" on you are very indifferent and have no sense of costumer service at all. I have gotten better results talking to COMCAST customer service than with these folks. And don't even think about asking to speak to the manager because this guy is, and pardon my French, a jerk. If you have gotten through ordering, dealing with the rude staff and if you followed the dumb rules, you are finally presented with what you came for..some tacos that are "ok," but definitely not worth putting up with all the hassle. Save yourself the trouble and skip this place all together. I suggest you go up to Raging Taco & Raging Burrito a couple of blocks up the street or even Taco Mac.
