I purchased a 2-year old certified pre-owned BMW from this dealership. The night I drove back home, I found that the rear window has some leakage. (You can hear the wind while driving on highway. Very likely it needs a new window seal). I admit that I should have paid attention to this kind of little things while test drive. (But this is a certified car from a dealer.) So I brought the car back the second day. They told me that this is not under warranty and want to charge me $175 just to diagnose the problem! Who knows how much they want me to pay to fix this thing. I walked away. So my advice is that NEVER TRUST THIS DEALER. STAY AWAY AS FAR AS POSSIBLE.
