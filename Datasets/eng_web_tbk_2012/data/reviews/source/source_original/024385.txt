Another great business bites the dust!

The best cakes EVER! A bit pricey, so I didn't go very often, but it was always a treat when I did. The prices were worth what I got. I'm assuming they are completely out of business since I can't find any contact information. I'm hoping the bakers continue to do their baking out of another place, because it would be a shame not to have these cakes any longer.
