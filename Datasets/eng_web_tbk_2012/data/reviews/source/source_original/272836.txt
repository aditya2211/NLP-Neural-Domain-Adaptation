So Handy for Local La Jolla Stuff - Especially for Finding Residential Numbers

Since moving back from college and trying to settle roots in the Village, I have referred to the La Jolla Blue Book for a ton of local numbers. The white pages allowed me to get in touch with parents of my high school friends so that I could track people down one by one and the restaurant section is basically my cookbook. It's really cool that so many local businesses are found so quickly in one place and I want to spread the word. THX:-)
