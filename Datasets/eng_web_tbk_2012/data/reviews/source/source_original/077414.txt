Small Firm with Great Service

Bloom Legal was really attentive to my problem, and Seth Bloom took the time to help me understand the legal issue I was dealing with. I much preferred the one-on-one service here to the experiences I've had with bigger offices and firms. While I hope I don't have any need for a lawyer anytime soon, if I do I'll definitely use this firm again.
