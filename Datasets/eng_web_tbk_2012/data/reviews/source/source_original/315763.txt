Love my home at Creekside

I moved to Creekside Apartments in August 2008 with a 6-month lease and have just extended it for another 13 months! The management from Julie and Janice to the work staff, esp. Edwin, are just wonderful. They have been extremely helpful whenever I have asked for help. Although the apartments are facing Stokes Street and close to the Bascom Light Rail, the location is surprisingly quiet. I have never had any problems with loud neighbors or concerns about safety. The apartments are within walking distance to Trader Joe's, Whole Foods, and other stores. The well-equipped, clean gym is a plus! Great place to live if you work in and around downtown San Jose!
