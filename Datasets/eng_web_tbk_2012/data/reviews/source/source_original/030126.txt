HORRIBLE

This school is the worst one i've ever been to. I attended it for 2 years, and that was enough. There's holes everywhere in the ceiling, sewage constantly leaks through the ceiling, and the whole condition of the school is horrible. The staff and the Principal are rediculous, they don't listen to any input, and they make up rediculous rules ( They banned backpacks, because a teacher TRIPPED OVER a student's). The education is horrible at best, do society a favor, and do NOT send your student here.
