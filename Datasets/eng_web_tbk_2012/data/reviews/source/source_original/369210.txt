When I arrived at Brickell Honda on 6/4/11, I was greeted and attended to by the Sales Manager, Gustavo Guerra, in a very friendly and professional manner. I explained to him what I wanted and that I previously went to Braman Honda. Bramen Honda was a bit of a hassle. He told me "no problem, we will match the offer or do better." Mr. Guerra gave me a better deal without any hassles nor any type of problems. Brickell Honda has been the best buying experience in the world. I urge all St. Thomas the Apostle parishioners and all of South Florida residents to come see Gus!!! Excellent customer service!!!
