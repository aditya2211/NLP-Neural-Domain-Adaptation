do NOT bring your car here

I got a coupon from Pennysaver for this station. Yes, they accepted it. However, during the test, they did whatever they can to get my test failed. Then, they sold me overpriced stuffs, such as oil tank cap, so that my car can pass it right away. I ended up paying much more.
