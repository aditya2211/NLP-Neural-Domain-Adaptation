Its been a few years since I have been to Ipanema. But my wife and I first went there thinking it would be Brazilian food (think lots of meat), but it turned out to be a vegan restaurant! And, I can say, this was one of my favorite places to eat in all of Richmond. Amazing! Don't let the nondescript building entrance fool you, these are some creative and talented chefs...two thumbs way, way up!
