Not so great

My husband just got a bike there as a gift he's only had it a month. It's a nice bike and it cost a lot of money. But just this week a peddle broke. He took it back and they would not honor a warranty and said it was his fault because of his shoes?? So they were going to charge him for new peddles and proceeded to put them on without even telling him the price. Which was very expensive. He asked for a different pair instead and they only gave him five dollars off?? Trek is not so great
