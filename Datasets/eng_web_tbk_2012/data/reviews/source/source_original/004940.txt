We have been blessed to find Elite Flyers online and would not use anyone else to handle our postcards, posters, etc. We were looking for a company with decent rates as our company was just getting started. They have the best rates and GREAT customer service. On one order, we needed it rushed and shipped to a different state. They did that with no problem. I also appreciate their honesty. I sent a graphic that would have been distorted if printed as it was. They called and worked with me to fix it so that it would look perfect. They recently surprised me a larger order. I ordered 1000 postcards, we normally order 5000 or more. Because they had room to do 5000, they created the larger amount, and shipped them early. I recommend this company to ANYONE and everyone that needs great work done at a reasonable rate! They have a customer for life in us!
