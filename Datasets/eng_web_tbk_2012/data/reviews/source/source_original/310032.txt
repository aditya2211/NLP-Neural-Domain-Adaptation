Gone downhill since change in ownership

Sigh. I used to LOVE this place. But now that they are part of a chain, service has slipped. I am waiting longer at BNA for my pickups and last time I parked with them, they lost my car key. Lucky I had a spare with me! To date they have not made good by either finding the key or paying for a new one. (These new car keys are EXPENSIVE to copy, you can't just go to WalMart.) Go to the website for coupons and join the club -you can get free parking. However, with BNA offering one day of free parking due to construction of the new rental car facility, it may be cheaper to park at BNA.
