Highly Recommend

I have worked with Shannon as my massage therapist and intuitive bodyworker for years and have never been disappointed. No matter what state I am in when I arrive, I always leave feeling better. She has not only helped me through some challenging computer-work and sports related injuries, she was wonderful to work with throughout my pregnancy and beyond. I highly recommend her.
