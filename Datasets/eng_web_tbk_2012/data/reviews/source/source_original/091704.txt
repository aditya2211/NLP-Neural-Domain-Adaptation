Oil Change Disaster

My wife had taken her '07 Ford Fusion in for a routine oil change. A couple days after the oil change, the engine ran rough, the low oil pressure light would come on sporadically, and the engine would whir loudly. Turns out the engine had no oil, and when oil was put it, it would just run out of the filter. There could have (hopefully doesn't have) major damage to the engine. All of this started after their oil change. Once they realized their mistake they sent a mechanic and tow truck to my wife's work and towed it back to fix it. I would not recommend this shop for anything, not even something as simple as an oil change. Plus they will overcharge you for just about everything, and smile while doing it.
