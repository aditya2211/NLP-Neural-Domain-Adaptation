Never again

Don't go here unless you want to sit,order,eat and be asked to leave all in a matter of 20 minutes. You won't even have time to read the entire menu before being asked to order and if you ask for more time your server will wait at the table. This is the only place I have ever eaten and been told to leave because other people were waiting. I was told to take my coffee to go if I wanted to finish it. Oh, and their liquor license was expired so no Bloody Mary or Mimosas. Plus the drinks are self service, have fun trying to negotiate the small cafeteria space to get your coffee, juice or water. Go next door to the Ball Square Cafe instead.
