Might try again

Pros: * Jill, the owner, is very nice and really cares about her feedback * Pretty nice atmosphere * Great Dessert * Not your typical veggie selection, I like! Don't know where else you can find Purple Hull Peas and some of the other sides. Cons: * Server wasn't very pleasant * Pretty small portion on the blackened catfish * Overcooked food * Time, took about 25 minutes from ordering to eating. Half the tables and bar were empty by this point. Other Thoughts: Will try this place again. There must be a reason so many people like it there. Their Club sandwich looks tasty, maybe that'll change my mind.... and a different server.
