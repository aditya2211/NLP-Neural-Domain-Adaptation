I just like the fact that he was able to do the specific type of repair I wanted (a reball) and give me the longest warranty and even a lower price. Someone else I found that said they could do it but wanted to charge me more and give me less warranty. It was a no brainer really. I choose Console Pros and I'm happy I did.
