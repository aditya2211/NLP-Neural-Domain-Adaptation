Dr. Shady

Kelly hit the nail on the head. "Dr. Shady" is a jerk. After the way she spoke to me on my last visit, I will not be returning!! Good luck keeping business with that stuck up attitude Dr. Shady. You have just lost mine. The next time you feel like being condescending to someone, it is not going to be me!!!!!! Dr. Shady is inexperienced and prideful. She probably does not even have 10% of the knowledge that some of the other EXPERIENCED vets do in this area. I will be carefully researching vets before I take my dog someplace else. Beautifully written reviews Doctor, but completely UNTRUE.
