A friend and I recently took our 16 and 18 month olds here. While there wasn't too much available for their age (ball pit, bouncy area and a little padded pyramid to climb on), we went right when they opened at 10 am on a winter weekday and ended up being the only ones there, so we were given a little more liberty than we would have if others had been there. It's not the classiest place, but it was cleaner than I expected and the staff was very friendly. For $4 it was a nice break from the monotony of winter indoors with a toddler.
