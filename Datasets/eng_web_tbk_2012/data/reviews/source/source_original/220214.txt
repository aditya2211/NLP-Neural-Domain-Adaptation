I think that there pretty good.  

First of all, if you call for an appointment they won't tell you to call back a month later so you can then make one. They also don't tell you that they're going to mail you an "application" to be admitted to be a patient. I feel that the way some doctors offices work around here is a little bit absurd so I'm happy that these guys don't do those two things in particlular. Usually you can be seen the same week or maybe the following week. The doctor did tell me that my male pattern baldness is due to my mothers father because the gene is exclusively passed on through maternal line but that's a common misconception (http://www.consumerreports.org/health/healthy-living/beauty-personal-care/hair-loss-10-08/hair-loss.htm). In general I would say that the staff is attentive and nice. But then again I was nice to them so that could have been why. Anyhow, after reading some of the other reviews it seems like some of the other reviewers are expecting mircles. If you want miracles you'll have to go to 21st St. It's a pretty typical primary care office but for the area it's very good. They don't do certain things that are really annoying about other offices.
