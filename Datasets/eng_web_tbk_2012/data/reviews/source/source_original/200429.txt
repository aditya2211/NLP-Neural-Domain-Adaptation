Horrible Service! I got yelled at, literally yelled at because i asked if i could pick up my car 5-10 minutes late. I explained that i was already on my way and i would rush to get there as soon as i could because i needed my car for work at 5am, but the guy was arguing with me saying he was gonna lock the doors right at 5:30. Rude, unprofessional, just jerks. Seems like all they care about is the money and getting home on time, NO care for the customers AT ALL!!! Missed a whole day of work because i am now carless. I will NEEEEEEEEEVERRRR go to this place again.
