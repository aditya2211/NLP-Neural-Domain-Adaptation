The best there is in service.

I was recently traveling down I-24 from Nashville with my 3 young children and had a blowout on the southeast side of Murfreesboro. It was 4:50 when a friend told me to call Bud, he would take care of me. Not only did they answer the phone at 4:50 on a Thursday, they hit the ground moving!. They tracked down the only tire that fit my BMW330i in Murfreesboro within minutes and secured it, then they came out, took off my tire (it was a runflat - but runflats don't do you any good if they blow out), and brought it to their shop to change the tire. They were back quickly considering how far outside of Murfreesboro we were and had us on our way by 6:30 that evening. Thanks Bud for all of your help and taking time away from your family that evening. It's without a doubt, the best service experience I've ever had and just to be clear, the price he charged me was the same as my tire guy in Nashville's price for putting on the other rear tire. I hope I can return the favor in the future! Alan Grissom
