Alto delivers on all levels. From the moment you enter the restaurant, you know you are some place special. The service is impeccable, and the food is even better. I highly recommend the four-course tasting menu, which gives you plenty of range and food to satisfy your appetite. Also, if you are into wine, Alto has the depth of both region, varietal, and vintage to satisfy nearly any sommelier (or after 9pm, bring your own bottle for free...no corking fee!). While it's not cheap, Alto will give you an experience you'll never forget.
