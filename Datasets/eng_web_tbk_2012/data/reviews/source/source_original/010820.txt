The moving company is actualy based in Brooklyn, but advertised all over NY/NJ, including Fort Lee. When the guys arrived (2 hours later than agreed) they told that you have to pay all the tolls they payed coming from Brooklyn and extra $100 for them to drive back from your destination. That was not in agreement eather, but they realy demand it. And another $100 for wrapping the furniture. So totalling $212 just for start before any work started. Guess what, was not in the initial agreement as well. I was moving out from 2 bdr apartment and it took for 3 strong guys 6 hours to load a track (from 2pm-8pm). The only reason I'm giving 3 stars instead of 1 or 2, I should admit, nothing was broken. So I still can recomend them but prepare pay twice as much as they tell you initially. One more thing, they don't take any credit cards or checks. You have to pay CASH ONLY before they start unloading track on your destination.
