No Customer Service

Employees seemed to be having a good time chatting and laughing with each other, while myself and other customers were completely ignored. Another person in the store stood there with an item and repeatedly tried to get a sales persons attention. It wasn't until he gave up and walked out the door that someone asked Can I help you.
