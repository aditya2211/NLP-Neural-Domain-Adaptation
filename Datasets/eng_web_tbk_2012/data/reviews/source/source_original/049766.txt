WWW-Wonderful Wild Wildernest inn

I would give the Wildernest inn ten stars of five! Atop Spring Mountain, from the decks of the West porch, "one can see forever" a scene of unparalleled beauty and grandeur. I saw deer frequently, in fact a small herd were grazing near the lodge. There were occasional bears on the deck in the morning. and most correctly, us visitors did not mingle with the native wildlife. It would have been more than one could bear! Kathy and Stewart, the proprietors were the epitome of perfection. Delightful, hospitable, superb,cozy and comfortable. I hope to be back!
