Had a horrible experience with a manager here, Rachel McInnis, she was rude, inconsiderate and did not do the right thing for an item that was marked incorrectly... I'm not interested in shopping in a place with people like her... she refused to sell me the item at its marked price even after admitting they had made a mistake. I normally don't write reviews but seeing that I considered Dillards a distinguished, upscale place to shop, this one won't be getting my business, nor my family's, nor my co-workers. It's never ok to let a customer walk out unhappy, especially when they are right.
