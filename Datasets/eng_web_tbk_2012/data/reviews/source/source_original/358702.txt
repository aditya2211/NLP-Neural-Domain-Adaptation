Slowest, Unfriendly Sstaff on Weekends

There are three Starbucks locations that I frequent. I have a bit of experience watching the usual assembly line. I also understand that weekend staffs are different than daytime staffs and not necessarily Starbucks A-team or even full-time. But this location has the worst weekend staff I've seen EVER.
