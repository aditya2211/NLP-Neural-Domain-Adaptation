Great Dude Cut!

Great service, cool vibe, impeccable style. I'ma guy with tricky hair so getting that right is job #1. After going through 5 other places I finally found Janice at Alta Moda. Not only was it a good cut but my wife and friends comment on my hair every time I leave...saying it's the best look I've ever had. Either I suck at my own style or Janice is a genius. Looks like there's a lot of talent in this place. Worth every penny.
