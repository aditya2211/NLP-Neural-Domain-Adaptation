Course has come a long way!!

HCC's new nine was a little shaky at first, but the NEW grounds superintendant has done wonders for the course!! The comment below definitely needs to be retracted! Come back and give HCC a second chance at least! It is a great course for local golfers to be proud of and all the comments in 2008 have been very positive!!
