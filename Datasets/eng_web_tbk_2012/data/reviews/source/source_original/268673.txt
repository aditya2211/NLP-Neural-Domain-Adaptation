tricky short guy

The new management is tricky and talk you into getting video rental agreement. To my surprise $20 deposit.... New movies not on shelf..under the counter for Telugu Speaking people only... or people who spend $30 or more groceries.. That did it for me..no more Raina's. Besides parking is a pain..cramped and un-ruly with Kumon Parents next door....gives me heebee gee bees'
