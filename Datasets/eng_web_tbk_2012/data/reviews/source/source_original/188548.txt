Good food, good wait staff, poor management

We visited on 7/26/08 for dinner We received a gift certificate for the Mama Mia's on Greenfield Ave. The food was good, and so was our waitress. When it came time to pay the bill up front, they would not let me use any of the certificate for a tip (which I have done with any other restaurant I've gotten a gift certificate for.) I then asked if I could have money back in cash. The person went to go check with the manager, who was sitting at a table chatting with her friends who were eating there. Her answer was short and manner rather rude. Sorry for interrupting I guess. The cashier was also short, unapologetic and made me feel as I was wasting her time. There were no other options available (I only brought my check card to cover any overage cost) and she rang it up and applied it to the gift card before telling me about the tip policy. I will not be visiting Mama Mia's again. There are other places with food just as good with management that values customers and employees much more.
