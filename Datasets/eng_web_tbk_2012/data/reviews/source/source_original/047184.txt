New training Centre is excellent

The Award Dance Centre has moved from its Holderness Road site to a new complex on Chamberlain Road Hull. The new Centre has 4 studios planned and now boasts the largest single dance floor area in Kingston upon Hull. The classes cover all age and skill ranges, with BALLROOM, LATIN, SEQUENCE, STREET, DISCO, LINE DANCING, BALLET, TAP & JAZZ. We have attended A Ward Dance Centre for over a year and really enjoy the friendly and welcoming way we are taught Ballroom and Latin as well as the fun filled social dance evening held every Saturday evening.... It is not really possible to score this school too highly, We would give it 12 out of 10 and 5 Stars across the board Steve & Anne
