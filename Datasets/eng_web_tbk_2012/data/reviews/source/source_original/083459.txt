They don't seem to be interested in selling cars.

Went there yesterday: we are trying to decide between two different Honda models, so we wanted to test-drive both back to back. The salesperson refused! Claimed he was too busy for two test drives. We were the only customers there! Don't waste time, just drive 10 minutes more down to Stevens Creek, they actually do try to help their customers there!
