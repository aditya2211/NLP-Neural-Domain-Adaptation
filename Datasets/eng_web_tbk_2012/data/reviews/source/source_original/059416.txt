Excellent food, fantastic wait staff

I recently threw a surprise birthday party for my wife at Fraiser's. We had 30 guests for the event, and everyone came away from the evening impressed with not only the food, but the outstanding service as well. The management was easy to deal with during the planning stages, and the execution by the kitchen and wait staff was flawless. I highly recommend Fraiser's for anyone planning a special event for friends, family or business.
