Terrible Service

One of the worst experiences I've ever had with a auto repair shop. We took our vehicle in for a repair to the air conditioning. Approx 4 months later, the compressor went out. We took it back in to have it repaired again, and less than a week later the second compressor went out. We went in for a third visit and they fixed it again, but this time when we picked up the car, the radio and clock did not work. So for the 4th time in 5 months and the third time in 2 weeks, we brought the car back again. When we expressed our discontent to the manager (that's right, the manager), did he say he would return some money, did he say he would give a discount on our next visit, did he just say "I'm sorry". Nope, none of the above. He stood there and told us how he wasn't at fault. It was the fault of the parts supplier, and can we imagine how he felt having to put another 2 hours of work in the car. And what did we expect...that he bench test every part. At no time during the conversation did the words, "I'm sorry" ever come out of his mouth. I, nor anyone else in my family, will ever go to Sun Devil Auto again. Well, unless of course the third compressor he put in the car goes out.
