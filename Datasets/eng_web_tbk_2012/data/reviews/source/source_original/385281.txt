Great first experience. I'm 22, and my hairdresser was great (and not "old" like one of the reviews says) - she really listened to what I wanted and gave me tons of tips on how to style my hair so I could get it to look the way I wanted it to. She deep conditioned my hair and took the time to style it properly. She recommended products but absolutely didn't pressure me to buy. It's a cute place with a really friendly, laid-back atmosphere. I would highly recommend it and will be going back for my next haircut. Oh! And students get $5 off, can't argue with that.
