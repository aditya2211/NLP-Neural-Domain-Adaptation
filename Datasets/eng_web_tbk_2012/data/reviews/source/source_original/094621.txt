Disatisfied customer, I went through Kitchen Aid and used one of their recommended vendors. A&E came out, charged $129 fee just to walk in the door. I needed a part for my appliance, the cost was very high so I said never mind, paid the fee and called a local business for a second quote. The second vendor charged $55 (less than half of what A&E charges) to come and applied that to the price of the repair service (which A&E does not). Their quote came in at half the price of A&E for the same work and same part. Seems to me like A&E charges way more than necessary! Very disappointed in Kitchen Aid as well, I thought that they pre-screened their vendors for price and quality of work, obviously they do not!
