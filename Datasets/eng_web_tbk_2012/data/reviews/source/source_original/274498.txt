Learn from a Cesar Gracie black belt and former ufc fighter! When i say jiu-jitsu or mma i mean it! Best jiu-jitsu mma in Santa Rosa and i have the experience and belt to back it up! When you come to ncfa you will see a real instructor that teaches and trains everyday! If your coach has no fights and you never see him train and sweat something is wrong!
