Excellent service

I could easily go to Nordstrom for my designer jeans and pay the same price, but I go to the Garment District for their service. Previous reviewers said they were pushy and I can understand that, but I find the staff more helpful than anything else. Tiffany is fabulous! I came in for alterations (free, by the way) and told her about a stain I had on my new leather purse. She immediately went to the back, brought out leather cleaner and cleaned my purse on the spot. I didn't even buy the bag there! Huge selection and, great suggestions from the staff and they refer you to reliable places if they don't have what you need.
