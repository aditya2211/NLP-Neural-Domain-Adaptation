For cheap Chinese food, this is the place to go. I used to eat at places like New China or Green Buffet in Troy, MO - nothing terrible but not that great. Now, I won't eat fast food Chinese unless it's from this place. The best value I've found from a Chinese restaurant. I don't live in Lake St. Louis anymore, but deliveries were always correct and the service courteous. Now I have to be in the area to get some lovin' :sadface:
