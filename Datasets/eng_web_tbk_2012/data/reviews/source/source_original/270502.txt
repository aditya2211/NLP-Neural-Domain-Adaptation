Great staff. Very helpful!!!! They interviewed me, gave me tests in the software I included on my resume, and placed me in a position that I kept for several years. Re-interviewed and am going on interviews for a new job. I'm really thankful for the folks at HR Office. They are dependable, have great connections in the community, and are a great resource for finding a job. I highly recommend them to all of my friends!!!!!
