The New Italian Kid on the Block

Another Italian restaurant in Collingswood? Do we need another one? Only if it is of the quality of That's Amore. The menu has the usual but then they step it up another notch. The arancini di riso (risotto fritters) are not to be missed. Chicken saltimboca was excellent and then there's the chocolate mousse that comes straight from heaven. Pay extra attention to the appetizers - the next time I go there I'm planning on ordered a few instead of an entree.
