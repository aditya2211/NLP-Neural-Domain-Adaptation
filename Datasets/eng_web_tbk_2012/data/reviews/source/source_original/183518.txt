An Asset to Richmond

For a long time, one big source of entertainment missing from the Richmond City Limits was a first-run multiplex. Bowtie has filled that role nicely. The theatre is in an old brick warehouse, which is a block away from the Flying Squirrels stadium. The owners of Bowtie manged to add something new while preserving what was already there. The theatre has greatly improved the surrounding neighborhood. There's plenty of parking, and I've never had an issue with audience members who won't stop talking or answering their cellphones. Best of all, there are no ads!!!!! Just previews and the main feature. Expect to pay full price, and the theatres themselves are on the small side. But if you like going to the movies, you should love Bowtie. The mangers also play a classic movies on Sundays, you can get a beer in the lobby, and repeat customers can get discounts if they have a member card. A great cinema in a great location. Thank you, Bowtie!
