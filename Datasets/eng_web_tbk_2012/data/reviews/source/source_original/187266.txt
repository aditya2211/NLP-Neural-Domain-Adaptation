Wish this was in Saratoga--

We were introduced to Bistro Tallulah by traveler-professional diner who happens to own the Adelphi Hotel and travels the world-- and residing in Paris,London, New York the rest of the year. SHE KNOWS GREAT FOOD AND DINING EXPERIENCES. She was dead on-- this restaurant was wonderful--- do not be put off by the one negative review on this page. I can tell you we were pleasantly surprised -- BT has taste memory and each time back the food was consistently delicious -- same dishes -- were consistent. Our friend is a world traveler and loves unpretentious dining experiences and inspired food. This chef knows what he is doing. Treat yourself and go-- you will go back! I am a business owner in downtown Saratoga Springs and wish this restaurant was in our town! The affordable rent makes it possible for an inspired chef to serve his high quality fare at affordable prices! Unlike Saratoga. I rrly seek the cehf out to introduce myself-- but the second time we went-- i made a point of asking our wait person to introduce my friend and myself to the chef to tell him just how good our meals were. Cannot wait to go gain. -R. Morris .
