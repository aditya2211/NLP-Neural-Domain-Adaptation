They won't have a second chance from me.

First, let me state that although I live in NYC, I am not from NYC, I don't care about baseball and I absolutely love Boston to death (so beautiful, so clean, so awesome). That said, I hated this restaurant. The service was just about as good as I'd get in NYC (that means it was poor) and the food was almost mediocre. The decor left a lot to be desired and the posters telling me all the reasons 99 was great just served as an ironic contrast against the reality. Personally I recommend you take your money elsewhere
