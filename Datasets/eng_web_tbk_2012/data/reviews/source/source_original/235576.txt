The Best Breakfast in Solana Beach! 

We love T's Cafe! Without a doubt the best place to grab a tall bloody mary and some eggs benedict. T's has been a North County landmark for thirty years and with good reason. Family owned and operated makes sure the atmosphere is relaxed and the food home-cooked with style. I highly recommend picking up a jug of their homemade bloody mary mix - definitely the best. If you've been to North County, chances are it's in your favorites list already.
