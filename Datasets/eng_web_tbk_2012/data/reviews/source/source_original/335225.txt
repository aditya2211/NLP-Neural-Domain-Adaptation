Best Salsa (hehehe)

After my trees were cleaned up, they gave me a jar of salsa. The owner warned me that it was the best salsa I would ever had, and he was right. No joke! I hate to say check them out just for the salsa, but James, I NEED another jar badly :) All kidding aside, they are a very good company, I have a hard time giving any service biz a 5 star review but they came close. Very affordable (don't call it cheap) and their trimmers were quick and courteous when I got home from work. And the salsa, be sure to ask for a jar and have plenty of chips around, you will need them.....
