Great help even near closing time!

I came in to town for a week and forgot my trainers! Oh no!! I came in 30 min before close and the staff was super helpful. They spent a lot of time with me and got me into a great pair of shoes. I think they may even be better than the pair I have been using this past year! Thanks Run on!
