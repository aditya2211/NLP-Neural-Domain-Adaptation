Quick to take money but not quick to fix a problem!

B&B came out very quickly to give us our quote back in June. They were very polite, eager to answer any questions and willing to wait for us to return from vacation to begin installing our fence. Our fence was installed quickly in August and they had their money and left saying "Workmanship is guaranteed for a year!". Within a week we noticed one of the boards on our gate splitting where a nail had gone in. We called our representative who assured me he would call the office and have it taken care of. We heard nothing. We then called the office and the man we spoke to said he'd send someone out to look at it but couldn't promise when- two weeks came and went and we heard nothing. I just called again and was told that workmanship, not wood, is guaranteed for a year- well in my opinion- the wood split due to a nail which is part of workmanship! She even went so far as to say "Your calling about one board?" Well- when you pay over $1000 for something you want it to hold up and look good!!! YES! I WAS calling about one board!! I'm very frustrated at this point- it would take all of 10 min for them to come by and replace the one board that is cracked (the crack is deep enough to stick a penny in it and it goes clear through) yet they do not want to take the time to bother with what once WAS a happy customer and has now become a dissatisfied customer. So I figure if they don't want to take the time to fix the fence that they installed then I'll take the time to let everyone I can know about how they treat customers once they have your money!!! STAY AWAY!!! YOU GET WHAT YOU PAY FOR!!! They came in under a lot of other quotes and now I know why!!! When the fence was first installed I would have given them five stars, now for their poor customer follow-up and unwillingness to fix the fence they have dropped to a one-star in my opinion!
