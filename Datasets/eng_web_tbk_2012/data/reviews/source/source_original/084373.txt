We are very pleased with the services of First Glass Window. Our window panes were so dirty that they needed a specialist to come and clean them. We called few companies before we decide to hire them. They came on time and completed their work quickly. We were very happy how clean looked our windows. If you have some problems with your windows, you should call them.
