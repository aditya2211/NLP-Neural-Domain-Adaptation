Worst Service I've Ever Experienced

I wish there was something good to say about the business, but unfortunately, there isn't. 1) Service and manners were nonexistent. 2) The employees constantly talk down to customers and are very argumentative for the sake of being argumentative. (to both myself and customers) 3) I have never experienced so much rudeness coming from a business. 4) The business is very unorganized. The invoice is not detailed, so it is difficult to see what you are paying for. I'd recommend to save your time and energy and find another greek store.
