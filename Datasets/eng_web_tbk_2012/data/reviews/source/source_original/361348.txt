HORRIBLE!!!!!

This has to be some of the worst pizza I have ever had the misfortune of ordering. The crust was lopsided, thicker on one side than the other. It actually had a hole in one of the slices. There was minimal cheese and sauce and it completely lacked flavor. I know New York pizza and this is not it!! This was nothing like New York style pizza!!!. I love pizza and this was a complete and utter disappointment!! I would not suggest this pizza to anyone!!!
