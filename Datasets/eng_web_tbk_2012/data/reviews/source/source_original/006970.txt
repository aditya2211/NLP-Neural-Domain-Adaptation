Wife and I attempted to adopt a dog and was nothing but frustrating. We arrived Sunday at about 230 and found a do we really liked. We were told that we couldn't today because they were closing soon. I called the next morning to let then know my wife would be driving in. They gave me the run around and missing paperwork only to call back to tell me someone else wanted her and I would need to come in and put down a deposit. I work 2 hours away but offered my card over the phone. They refused. Terrible communication as well. At one point they told me the dog had been fixed, the next day it hadn't. Huge ammount of time wasted time and elevated blood pressure.
