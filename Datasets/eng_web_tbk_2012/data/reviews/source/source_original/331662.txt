Nice selection, very clean, friendly staff!

Hot Iron has become a favorite of our family. Everyone can get the signature dish with ingredients and spices that they want and have the fun of watching it cook. The staff are very friendly and conscientious. They always ask if you have meat in your dish, (for vegetarians like me), they scrub an area of the grill and use separate utensils to cook. They don't just dump your ingredients on and cook either, but carefully separate meat to the hotter parts of the grill and still manage to keep the veggies from turning to mush. The selection of meats, veggies and sauces is awesome too! Every time we go they seem to have a different ingredient or two which keeps things interesting. Meats are kept VERY cold, seafood smells fresh and the serving bar is VERY clean. Prices are reasonable, (Kids meals are around 4.99) and Wednesday's they have discount dinner prices, I believe.
