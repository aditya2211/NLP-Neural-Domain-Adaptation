Superb Arrangements

I used Fancy Flowers for my late husband's funeral flowers as they had been recommended to me. I am so glad that I called in to see Ana, she is a lovely girl who showed nothing but care and compassion towards me. The flowers were all that I hoped they would be, I have attended several funerals of late unfortunately and the flowers I recieved from Ana outshone them all. She is so talented, the flowers were arranged superbly and delicately, it is so obvious to see the difference between someone fully trained and skilled compared to others. Thank you Ana I hope to see you in the future under better circumstances.
