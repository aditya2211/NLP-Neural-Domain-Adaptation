Eulogic

Good place to be on a Sunday Night. The beers were good, nice choice of beers as well, and as usual the mussels were great, the place upstairs is a nice addition to the bar downstairs. Filled up on too much beer and hence cannot comment on the food. But the menu had standard stuff that one would get at a Belgian Tavern. If you are a handcraft beer person, this is a fantastic place to be.
