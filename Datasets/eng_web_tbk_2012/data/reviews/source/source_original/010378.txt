Poor Experience

I did not have a good experience w/ Dr. Ghassemlou. During the session, he demanded to have my physical address, which I've always kept private as I am enrolled in a witness protection program. I believe he is correct in that he needs my physical address for legal reasons, however, he did not adequately explain this during our session. I learned more about this doing my own research afterward. I think he could've done more to assuage my concerns by giving me concrete facts. Saying that I need to give him my address or else I have intimacy issues is not helpful. It's pretty combative actually.
