Le petit is the best place to get your nails done! It is very clean, staff is friendly, and I have never waited! I go every other week for the shallac/gel manicure which is only $25 and it truly lasts 2 weeks! I love it. Pedicures are also great. Try this place out! I promise you will not be disappointed!
