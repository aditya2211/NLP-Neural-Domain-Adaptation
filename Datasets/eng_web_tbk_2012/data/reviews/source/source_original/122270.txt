Perfect Practice

After I had chosen The Fountain Dental Practice they provided a slick and professional service from start to finish. Everyone was friendly from the receptionist to the surgeon herself, putting me at my ease and explaining the whole process, both initially and then as we went along. Surgery visit timings were always made to suit me and not them and they gave me the feeling that I mattered and was important to them. The surgery itself is slick, modern and very relaxed and I always felt that I was in capable hands. My dental surgeon, Dr. Lucy Nichols is clearly a dental perfectionist and clearly proud both of the work she does and the reputation she has established. Everyone was so helpful that I cannot wait to go back ..... Peter
