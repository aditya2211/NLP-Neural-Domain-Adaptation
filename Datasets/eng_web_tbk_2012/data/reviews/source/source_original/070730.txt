We decided to try this place last night because we noticed that it had some interesting things on the menu aside from the usual rolls-- live scallop sashimi, duck breast nigiri with foie gras, panko mussels-- but none of these were particularly great or worth the sticker price. Additionally we tried the Logan Circle roll, spicy crab and tuna roll, and sweet potato tempura roll ($15, $10, and $3.75 respectively). The sweet potato tempura roll was actually a great surprise: cheap and delicious, the only thing we tried that I would say was well worth it and a great value (and I never get vegetarian rolls). The other rolls weren't at all special, especially given their pricing. The bottom line is that the food isn't great and is relatively high-priced. The service is solicitous, the atmosphere is nice and mod except the out-of-place flat-screen TV playing football. But I'd go elsewhere unless the prices are cut. It's just not worth it.
