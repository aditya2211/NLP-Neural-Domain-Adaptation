College is a Joke and the Salon is  a JOKE!

Went to the school here OVER PRICED!!!!!! You do NOT learn the things you were promised. You have to bring in your own models and they have to pay for you to use them if you dont then you can graduate! Going back after graduating your told you get a discount on services nope you dont. Staff is under educated. Going there you learn the school does not care about the services given just about the money. Over priced for students to learn! Beware of the nail program you are not taught to use a nail drill AT ALL you learn the old fashioned way of doing nails you will not be able to do well in a salon!!! BEWARE!
