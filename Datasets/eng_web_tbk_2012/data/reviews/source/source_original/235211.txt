Lovely People, Great Hats

I was saddened to see the reviews that claimed World Hats Mart has poor service. It led me to believe that the reviewers simply had difficulty tolerating people with strongly-accented English. The husband and wife who run this spot are lovely people. We have had many conversations with them and they have always been extremely patient with me as I tried on multiple hats in search of the right costumes for my magic act. I recommend them highly!
