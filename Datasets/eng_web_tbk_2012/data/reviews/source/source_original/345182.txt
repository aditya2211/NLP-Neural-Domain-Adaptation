Do not use this company!

I dropped off a sheet metal piece that I needed copied due to th it was needing to be replaced. I asked if they could copy the piece I dropped off. They said it would be made exactly like the one I needed to replace. I picked it up when it was finished and was charge 30.00. When I got to the job and tried to insert the new piece of metal IT WOULD NOT FIT!! I took the original piece of metal and rigged it to make due since I had to complete the job. I took the receipt and the metal that did not fit and asked Pomper for my money back. The girl at the desk was sooo rude I could not believe it! She told me she could not use the piece I was returning and the company would only put it in the trash so I could not return it. I explained I did not get what I paid for. She asked me to bring the original piece back and I told her I had to use it on the job. She told me that was to bad she would do nothing to help me since she could not use or resell the piece. I said I was going to trash it also and could I at least have a credit. With a smirk on her face she told me NO MONEY IS BEING RETURNED and THAT IS THE WAY IT WAS. DO NOT USE THIS COMPANY. There are to many people that need our business to have to put up with this unfair treatment!!!!!
