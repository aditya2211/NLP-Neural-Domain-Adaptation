I googled restaurants in the area and Fuji Sushi came up and reviews were great so I made a carry out order of : L 17. Mixed Tempura.....................8.25 Shrimp or vegetable tempura & salad. I was very happy with the customer service and even more please with the portion size, to go box set up and quality of the food for the price. I'm very happy and will definitely dine in and carry out again.
