Internet Department is rude and insulting

I was looking to bring a customer to their lot to buy a car but the Internet salesperson Last name is Balazick sent me this email "AND IF IT WAS WORTH MY TIME I WOULD OF BOTHERED ASWERING YOUR QUESTIONS. I MAKE MONEY NOT DEAL WITH BROKERS" Wow, can you believe in todays tough times this dealership would be looking for any way to move vehicles. As a previous Internet Manager I would deal with anyone looking to buy a car for a profit and not care if they came in with a broker. Stay away from this dealership!!!
