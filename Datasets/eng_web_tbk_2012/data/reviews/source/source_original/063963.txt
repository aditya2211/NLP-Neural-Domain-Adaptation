Don't waste your time or money!

I took my 3 year old son here at the weekend and to be honest, apart from the shark walkway, I thought it was rubbish and overpriced. Even taking into account the fact that my 3 year old wanted to run most of the way round, it took us just over one hour start to finish. If you have been to the London Aquarium I would not even bother with this. If you are really desperate for something to pass the time and are willing to shell out the best part of Â£30 for 2 two people then go for it. (For some reason itwill not let me rate it one star - it is not rated 5 by me!)
