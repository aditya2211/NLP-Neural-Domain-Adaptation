Dave is a patient and methodical teacher, who has a great ear and sensitivity for his students' passion and the direction they want their lessons to take. Also, he loves teaching so much, his price is unbeatable, but that does not change his level of skill. Dave has much to offer. In just 2-3 focused lessons, I'm already now capable of picking up new songs off YouTube guitar how to videos and am even writing my own orginals with confidence! ~Jason
