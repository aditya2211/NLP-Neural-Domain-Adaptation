This place is bad. It's dark, dingy & dirty. The salads are limp and the rest of the food isn't any better (ok, the nachos are not too bad!) This place may have been something sometime; but it way past it "sell by date". I have eaten here twice in the past year and will not go back and cannot recommend it.
