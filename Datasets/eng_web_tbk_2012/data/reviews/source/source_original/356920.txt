I called on a Friday at 12:30 complaining of a severe toothache. Dr. Obina told me that his office closed at noon and that I should call him on Monday. I had been a patient of Dr. Olbina for 9 years and had spent thousands of dollars on crowns etc. There are plenty of good dentists in Fernandina. Don't go to Amelia Gentle Dentistry.
