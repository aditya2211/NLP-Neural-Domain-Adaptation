Believe me. This is THE premier university in Virginia. It is also the largest. With a Pizza Hut, IHOP, 3 Starbucks, Chilis, Panera, and Chipotle on campus ALONE, VCU has some of the best eating options for students. VCU has the #1 art school in America, and EXCELS in healthcare and medical schooling. The Rams, the VCU sports team, also made the NCAA Final 4 this year, too! VCU also offers high-rise living for students and professors, and the historic yet fixed-up houses in the Fan are also available to students, professors, or even people wanting to live in a safe, viable community. VCU is also minutes from Downtown Richmond, Canal Walk, Carytown, Stony Point, Short Pump, and the VCU Medical Center. It is the best university in Virginia and continuously receives rave reviews every year. The U of R is also recommended, too!
