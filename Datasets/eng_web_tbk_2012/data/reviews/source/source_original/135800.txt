Liars, negative stars! Took my Cruze in twice for poor fuel economy. The first time they claimed to get reasonable mpg. However, they would never drive the car with me in it to prove their findings. I wonder if they were going down a hill! They told me to bring it back after 5000 miles. I brought it back with 9000 miles. They "finished" the work and told me the car was ready. I found out they did not even drive the car, stated they looked at it before. They still would not drive the car with me to show their mpg number. They also claimed not to see anything wrong with the blower fan (a seperate issue), but when I drove the car home I had the same symptoms. I will never purchace another vehicle from Vic Canever.
