Rcommended by bees, too!

Highly recommended. Joe removed a wasp nest for our condominium building and we appreciated the environmentally friendly method and prompt, friendly and informative service. No spraying of pesticides! Very professional. Reasonable rate. We highly recommend Joe and his wasp removal service to individual home owners and condos. He knows his bees! Suzanne, Vancouver
