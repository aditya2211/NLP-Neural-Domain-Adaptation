We were expecting a great experience, when we recieved a friendly greeting by the hosts. The atmosphere was nice and very clean. The menu had plenty of options even for picky eaters. The service was ok, our waitress kept forgetting our drinks even though we reminded her several times. To start we tried the guacamole and salsa verde, it was completly flavorless. We should have left then. We orderd our meals anyway, chimichangas,jalapeno borritos, and quesadillas. Everything was bland, completely void of any spice or flavor. We have never had mexican food this bad, it was just simply gross. Hopefully they spice things up or they wont be in business long. I recommend La Hacienda
