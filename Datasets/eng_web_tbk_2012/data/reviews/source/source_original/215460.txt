Beware of Sharayu 

Hopless service, at the time of booking my car a lot was promised but delivered not even one tenth of what was promised. Apart from that in spite of my repeated attempts I could not get in touch with the manager to even lodge an official complaint. My advise to all is I have fallen into this trap ... pl ensure you dont!!!
