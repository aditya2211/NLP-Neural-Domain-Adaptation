My Favorite place at Wildwood

I have been going to the Wildwood, NJ for over 30 years for summer vacations and always call the Madrid first. I rated it 5 stars. I am not saying it is a 5 star hotel. I am saying when comparing all other hotels in Wildwood, this hotel has everything that we are looking for. It is the hospitality from Tom and staff, that makes it feel like a 5 star hotel in the middle of the beach. We prefer the layout of rooms and it is always clean.
