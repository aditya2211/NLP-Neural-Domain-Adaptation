Friendly staff, but definitely some problems

May, 2009. We were booked at the Sheraton with a number of other out-of-town wedding guests. Got put into the wrong room the first night, and were quite surprised to have someone with the same room key trying to get in the door at 1:00 am! Next day got moved into another room, on the same floor with other wedding guests. There were 3 adults in our room but towels for only 2, no linens for sofa bed. In the second room it took 3 tries to get all the towels and linens we requested. A package and some wedding cards were left in our first room. They were sent to our second room and had been opened--the ribbon-wrapped present, and all 3 envelopes. Security in the hotel seemed to be excellent, but we were never given an explanation as to why someone would open these items. A mid-afternoon "fire drill" was disruptive, putting everyone out of the hotel. When we called the front desk about an extremely boisterous crowd in the hall outside our door quite late at night, it seemed to take the hotel staff quite a while to quiet them down. The staff was friendly, especially the front desk female supervisor, and seemed to want to help, but too many unusual things happened to make us want to stay there again.
