AMAZING NIGHT- Great Party Spot!! 

Went to the Willow Lounge this past weekend for dinner and drinks...place is awesome. Had to keep in mind that the A/C broke, I feel bad it was their opening! Anyway, once that is fixed, this place will be amazing. Drinks were awesome, prices reasonable, and staff friendly. This is an awesome date spot that the area SERIOUSLY needs. Check out The Willow Lounge, youll be happy!
