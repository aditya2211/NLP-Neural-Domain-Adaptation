The Worst Experience Ever!!!

I have worked with Ted Jurek at Decor and You, and it started out as a decent experience. He was referred to me by a friend, who didn't have the best experience with Ted, but said that Ted was able to make up for his lack of preparedness at the end. I figure I would give this company a chance. However, after giving a required $500.00 (NON REFUNDABLE) deposit before seeing any plans or ideas, I was sorry I did. We met a couple of weeks later, Ted was late. He brought fabric books, and pictures of furniture only, which all came way over budget. By the time we got to the budget i told him I could work with, there was basically no design. Just curtains and a couple of accessories. WHAT IS THAT????? This company is way too expensive with nothing to show for it. Please everyone....take heed and don't get caught up in the hype about DECOR and YOU working with every budget...This is just a way for them to squirm their way into your precious pocket
