Great, Honest Service

I took my 2001 Nissan Frontier in to fix a cracked manifold. The dealer wanted $1300 to fix that and another $1500 to fix some other things. Eagle Transmission determined that much of the work the dealer said needed to be done was unneccesary and what needed to be fixed was only $400!! I was so impressed with the honesty and integrity of Mike and everyone at Eagle Transmission! I dropped the truck off in the morning and it was ready that afternoon. I have finally found a mechanic I trust!! And it was great that they did not charge a service fee to diagnose the problem - an added bonus!!
