Tried Crust on Broad on 3 occasions. Twice for dinner and once for lunch Absolutely rude service every time! The staff will not even answer the phone for take out. Tonight, I called several times with no answer (Btwn 5:30 and 6 pm) and finally drove there to place my order in person. There was not a customer to be found.
