Grocery and Daily Needs Store

Before using FusionRetail Before installing FusionRetail store was running on a dos based software. We were having a major problem in maintaining cash. Being a grocery shop, maintaining 5000 different products was a challenging job. Managing POS counter without barcoding was really a tough time. How FusionRetail has overcome these issues ? FusionRetail helps us to maintain the store in an organised way. Usage of product barcodes and smooth maintenance of inventory with proper recording of transactions like sale, purchase and returns was never easy before. How long does it take to train new people at work ? Billing takes 15 minutes and backoffice jobs takes 1 day's training How fast your support queries get answered ? Over telephone, immediate. On call, it takes a day to get our issues resolved.
