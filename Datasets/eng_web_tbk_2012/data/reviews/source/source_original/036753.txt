i made the mistake of buying from these thieves.I paid 2k cash for a truck with a blown motor.Their so called mechanic said the engine was good and "There is nothing mechanicly wrong with this truck".Well I think a blown engine falls under the catagory of mechanics right?Anyway they jimmy rigged it so i could drive it home.The next day i took it to 2 auto shops and they both told me the same thing,engine is junk.I called and got the same runaround on hold and noone calls you back.From a moral standpoint,you guys are really gonna take 2,000 bucks from someone that needs that truck to work and support his family when you know its just a piece of scrap metal?If it lasted 1 month i could suck it up but 1 day?Grimy work you guys do.Buy your kids somethin nice with my 2k bucks.
