Bit sketchy, sporadic delivery times

I bought about half of the furniture I own from this place. Why? Because they cut me good deals if I paid in cash. Sketchy, right? Well they came through and delivered almost all of my items within a few days. (They even got me a couch pretty quickly.) The guy who was cutting me the deals and getting me the furniture quickly, Ahmed, was nice and mostly professional, except the semi-sketchiness. Then one day, Ahmed left the country, not to return for months, WITHOUT informing me. He also neglected to tell the other person working at the store about a dining room table that I had ordered and that was supposed to be coming in. The other person working at the store didn't know that I still had this table coming. I had paid in cash, and he said he had no receipt/record of my purchase. I came back with the receipt Ahmed had provided upon my purchase, and the guy took forever to copy it but said that he would take care of the situation. I waited. And waited. He never once contacted us. I've had to pester this new guy several times to ask when my table will arrive. He kept saying different arrival/delivery dates and didn't seem terribly apologetic. It has been 3 weeks and I STILL don't have my table (which was NOT cheap, I might add). Point is: You might be able to get a good deal on some nice furniture -- which I did -- but they're not very communicative and god forbid something goes wrong, you'll have to fight to get it resolved.
