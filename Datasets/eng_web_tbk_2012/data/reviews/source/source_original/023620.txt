This is one of the worst places I have stayed, we cut out stay short and went to the Mulberry. Even though they still charge you the days you booked but won't use, it is worth the get the hell out of this crap hole. The whole experience shows a hotel managed by what must be a 2 star hotel manager. Bad service starting from the front desk. The best person is the valet. Short of that, avoid this place, as a silver Marriott member, this is a disgrace.
