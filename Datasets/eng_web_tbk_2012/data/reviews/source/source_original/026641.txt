You've Got Maids did a fabulous job cleaning my home. I am hiring them to come once a week now that they got my house to where they can maintain it for only an hour and a half every two weeks! Satisfactory for sure with the sercvice! Beats having one "cleaning lady" who took twice as long and did not do a very through job like the "maids" did!
