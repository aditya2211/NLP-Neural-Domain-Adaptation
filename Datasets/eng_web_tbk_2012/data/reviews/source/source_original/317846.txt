Great Sanwiches, Great Prices

I used to go here almost everyday since I work in the neighbourhood and loved their turkey and meatball sandwiches. Chicken salad salad is great too. Best of all, the staff is quick on their feet and even with long lines, usually serve you in 5 minutes or less. For the quality, the prices ($4-$6) have to be the best in town. The staff get to know regulars and do their job very well. Tourists like the other reviewer might not appreciate their efficiency or quality, but I certainly do. This isn'ta TGIF or Cafe, its a lunch sandwich place and a good one at that.
