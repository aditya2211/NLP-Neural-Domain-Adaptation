Extremely helpful and professional

As first-time home buyers, my husband and I found Stephanie Fairchild at Prudential Steamboat Realty, extremely helpful. She worked with us for over a year, helping us find our perfect home. Stephanie's knowledge of the market and properties in our price range, made us feel secure in our decision to buy when we did. We would highly recommend Stephanie to anyone looking for a home in the Yampa Valley. We appreciated her patience, knowledge and kindness!
