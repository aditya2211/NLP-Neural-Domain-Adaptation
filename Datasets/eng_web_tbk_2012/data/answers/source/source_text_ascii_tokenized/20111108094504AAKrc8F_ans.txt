<en=1>Planning on going to New Zealand in January .
<en=2>Is it OK to holiday in Christchurch since the Earthquakes ?
<en=3>Are the hotels back up and running ?
<en=4>Are there still aftershocks ?
<en=5>Planning on going to North and South Island .
<en=6>Is it safe to go to Rotarua , since the earthquakes ?
<en=7>Rotorua is fine .
<en=8>I 'm assuming this was in reference to the January earthquake , do n't worry , it was very deep , so nothing was effected :)
<en=9>As for Christchurch , yes the aftershocks are still happening , but these are fairly small - you can feel them , but the do n't do any damage .
<en=10>Since lots of people are still living there , then it must be fine to visit .
<en=11>However the CBD is closed of to the public as a lot of it is still rubble and stuff and has n't been cleared away yet .
<en=12>I 'm sure that you can find some hotels that are running in the christchurch area , but if not then there would be some in close by towns .
<en=13>Despite the aftershocks I would recommend going to Christchurch , just for the experience and then you can see first hand how things get effected by earthquakes .
<en=14>Have fun in New Zealand !!
<en=15>( ps. I 'm assuming you 'll stop off in Wellington , and since it s summer , may I recommend kaffee eis ice creams and gelatos ?
<en=16>Just recently discovered them last time I was down there , they 're very nice ) www.kaffeeeis.co.nz
<en=17>Loads of places have geographical hazards , if you are constantly paranoid , you 'll never get anywhere without a sense of adventure .
<en=18>In case of an earthquake , stay under a sturdy table and do n't go outside as possible debris will fall .
<en=19>Yes it 's ok .
<en=20>Yes , yes and yes .
<en=21>Nothing wrong with rotorua
