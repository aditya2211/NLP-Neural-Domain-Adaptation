<en=1>3 weeks old baby budgie alone at night ?
<en=2>I have a 3 week old baby budgie and I noticed that his / her mother does not stay with him in the nest at night .
<en=3>I have to mention that i recently separated the father into another cage close to the ' nest cage ' because he and the mother were fighting .
<en=4>He was so eager to go in the nest and feed the baby and she always would go right away in the nest after him and give him a fight right there , were the baby was too .
<en=5>I thought it was dangerous for the baby so I moved him .
<en=6>She feeds well the baby on her own , the baby is ok but she does not go in the nest to stay with him at night ...
<en=7>What is the problem ?
<en=8>Is this a transitional period for the baby ... that he / she is left alone much more time ?
<en=9>I have to say that the baby does not scream after her of anything ... he / she sleeps .
<en=10>Budgies are breast feeding birds and it may be the male is bisexual .
<en=11>When the male gets his titts out the female gets mad with him knowing he ca n't produce milk .
<en=12>It 's fine - just make sure that the room the cage is in is kept warm .
<en=13>If the baby is feathered yet - which I 'm sure he is mostly - he should be fine .
<en=14>Just remember to make sure the mother is properly caring for the baby .
<en=15>Ignore the answer above me , btw ! ^_^
