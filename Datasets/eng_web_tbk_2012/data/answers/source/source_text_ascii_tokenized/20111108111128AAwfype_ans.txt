<en=1>I 'm American and I am going to the UK for the first time , what should I expect ?
<en=2>I just need to talk to an another american who has gone to the UK before so that I know what expect when arriving at the airport and with going through visa process and everything .
<en=3>do you get your visitor s visa immediately at the airport ?
<en=4>I was told that americans automatically get a six months visitor s visa .
<en=5>do you have to go through a medical exam right away ?
<en=6>drug test ?
<en=7>blood test ?
<en=8>or do i just show them passport and walk through the gates ?
<en=9>i have talked to some people that say that a medical exam is an invasion of privacy and other say it s a routine thing when entering another country .
<en=10>I honestly have no idea what to expect or prepare for and calling in to get professional advice from either of the embassies costs by the minute - which I really do n't have the money for .
<en=11>I 'm really worried cause I have no idea who to talk to and want everything to go smoothly .
<en=12>An American passport should get you right into the country , there is no need for a VISA , for six months .
<en=13>There is no medical exam or blood test or others like that .
<en=14>You do not need to call the embassies to get professional advice .

<en=16>Above is the link to the Department of State travel website , which will give you all the info that you need , including passport information .
<en=17>It is free .
<en=18>I never stayed more than two weeks at a time when I visited the U.K .
<en=19>You should be fine with just a passport , unless you 're staying longer than six months .
<en=20>You should double check with the necessary embassy before you leave though .
<en=21>I am not sure how well you planned this trip .
<en=22>You 'll have a great time , so no worries there .
<en=23>I visited London , Edinburgh , and St. Andrew s so far , and I was treated very well and with great kindness .
<en=24>Just treat everyone else as you would want to be treated , and you 'll be fine .
<en=25>That tactic never failed me .
