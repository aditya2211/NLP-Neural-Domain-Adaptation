<en=1>canon t2i stops working ?
<en=2>My canon t2i stops working at times as in the power bottom is switched to " on " but the camera does not respond to any function .
<en=3>the camera only begins to work again when i take out the battery and put it back in .
<en=4>did anyone have this issue ?
<en=5>is it worthy to send in for warranty repair ?
<en=6>thanks !
<en=7>Sounds simple enough to me .
<en=8>Your camera is n't acting normally , you got warranty , let Canon deal with it .
<en=9>I would agree .
<en=10>I shoot a t1i and have n't had such an issue .
<en=11>I also agree it 's under warranty so get in touch with Canon .
<en=12>It sounds like a firmware issue and the camera requires a re-boot just like what happens in a computer - needs a re-start from time to time but it should n't be happening in a camera .
<en=13>Call Canon
