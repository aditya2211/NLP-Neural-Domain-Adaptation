<en=1>how many ounces in a pint in ireland ?
<en=2>Depends of what .
<en=3>Ounces measure weight , pints measure volume .
<en=4>If you mean fluid ounces , 20 , as opposed to the 16 in America .
<en=5>An Irish pint is larger than a US one .
<en=6>20 fluid ounces in a Pint in Ireland
<en=7>as R - G said , there are only 16 in an American one .
<en=8>Know this well because I remember an ' irish ' pub in the town in canada i grew up in used to advertise the cheapest pints of guinness in town , but they served them in american sized pints .
<en=9>That place did n't stay open too long :D
