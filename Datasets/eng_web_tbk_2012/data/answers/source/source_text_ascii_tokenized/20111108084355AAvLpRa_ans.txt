<en=1>Are there any new Gaming console ?
<en=2>I do n't know should i buy PS3 or X - BOX Kinect .
<en=3>Or even N - DS or PSP .
<en=4>I 'm a little afraid when i buy PS3 or X - BOX then a newer version comes out .
<en=5>( Same for N - DS and PSP )
<en=6>Wii U has been announced as well as the PS4 however the PS4 is only in development while the Wii U should be out next year .
<en=7>Microsoft has not announced there new console yet though it is believed to be in the works .
<en=8>No matter when you buy you will get a newer version .
<en=9>I feel X - BOX is a very smooth system i own it like 3 years , it s very compatible to previous versions and mostly important i was very comfortable with the User Interface and the JOYSTICK .... coz you do nt wan a hold a joystick that gives you discomfort .
<en=10>XBOX Joys are soo comfyy .....
<en=11>Performance - You get the same in all , just get a good TV .
<en=12>I do n't know about the playstation situation but I do know that Microsoft has said they do n't see the Xbox 360 as being even halfway through its lifetime .
<en=13>Since they released kinect this was kind of their way of releasing a new Xbox so they do n't plan on making another one for a while .
<en=14>I do know they have already announced a new wii though and I do n't know what Sony has said about playstation but again , if you get an Xbox ( which I personally think is the best anyways ) you should be set for a while .
