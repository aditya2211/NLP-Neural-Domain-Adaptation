<en=9>CHILL OUT !
<en=10>Firstly , your hammie was not stressed out , he wanted attention .
<en=11>Secondly , that is normal behavior as they use the wheels in the night .
<en=12>Thirdly , just put your hand in his cge ans leave it their .
<en=13>He willl eventually come and explore it and them you can handle him a little bit .
<en=14>Hope I helped !
<en=15>Give him time .
<en=16>You only got him yesterday .
<en=17>He 's probably still scared and unsure .
<en=18>Once he has properly settled down , got use to the new smells and noises he will be fine .
<en=19>Once he is more comfy with his surroundings , then you can start handling him and getting to know each other more .
<en=20>But just give him time for now .
