<en=1>why does my baby king snake refuse to eat ?
<en=2>i have a baby eastern king snake .
<en=3>i have tried EVERYTHING i can to get him to eat but he refuses .
<en=4>he has a great environment , with water and lots of hiding places and a heat lamp .
<en=5>as far as i know , everything is as good as it can be where his aquarium is concerned .
<en=6>according to the vet , he is healthy and looks good .
<en=7>he has been going to the bathroom like he should .
<en=8>( i know that snakes that have problems going to the bathroom wo n't eat . )
<en=9>he has been drinking water ( i am pretty sure he has been drinking it out of his bowl , but also i have been feeding him water and he does n't ever give me a problem with that - i just stick his head near the water and he sucks it down . )
<en=10>i handle him every few days .
<en=11>he is feisty , as most king snakes are , but he is a very nice little guy - he never tries to bite or anything .
<en=12>i just love him to death .
<en=13>i do n't know why he wo n't eat though !
<en=14>i have tried feeding him 5 or 6 live pinkies and 4 or 5 frozen ( thawed ) pinkies .
<en=15>i have never tried feeding him a pinky that was bigger around than he is .
<en=16>i have tried putting him in a small container and putting him in a dark place for an hour or so and he wo n't touch the pinky .
<en=17>he crawls on top of them but does not try to eat them .
<en=18>he does n't seem to know that they are food .
<en=19>i have tried " braining " both live and dead pinkies , and bloodying them up to get his attention , but he does n't care .
<en=20>i have tried dipping both live and thawed pinkies in tuna juice , and in used gerbil bedding .
<en=21>i have bought some long reptile feeding tweezers and have tried holding the pinky in front of the snake 's face .
<en=22>he wo nt even try to bite .
<en=23>i am very discouraged and sad and i do n't know what to do .
<en=24>he has n't eaten in an entire month .
<en=25>i 've only tried to feed him one at a time .
<en=26>he 's just a tiny baby , about the width of a pencil .
<en=27>do babies this small hibernate ?
<en=28>When you feed him how many pinkies do you feed him ?
<en=29>If you feed him too many he could just not be hungry .
<en=30>If he does n't seem interested in them at all I would say he 's just not hungry .
<en=31>My boyfriend has one and when she 's hungry she attacks the pinkie right away .
<en=32>They can smell it so i 'm sure he knows what it is and just do n't want it .
<en=33>Remember snakes can go a while without eating .
<en=34>In the winter , they will usually go deep underground and enter a hibernation - like state called brumation , which is characterized by a slowed metabolism and reduced activity .
<en=35>King snakes sometimes stop eating , particularly during the cooler part of the year .
<en=36>They have a natural instinct to hibernate .
<en=37>If the snake is not pregnant or shedding , and its enclosure is properly equipped , a loss of appetite probably signals a beginning of hibernation .
<en=38>Hibernation is natural , and a necessity for snakes that are going to be bred .
<en=39>Another thing that can cause a king snake to stop eating is shedding .
<en=40>You can tell when your king snake is about to shed , because its eyes will get milky looking .
<en=41>Its body will be dull looking , too .
<en=42>In a few days the snake will begin to shed its skin .
<en=43>For example , some snakes will routinely go off their food in both the summer and winter , feeding mainly in spring and fall .
<en=44>It 's natural and so long as you do n't see any serious deterioration in their health is nothing to worry about .
<en=45>You see , some snakes for no obvious reason will simply go off their food .
<en=46>They 're fit and healthy and their care is suitable .
<en=47>hope this helped .
<en=48>That 's why it 's good to have a python !
<en=49>It 's twice my size and eats a rabbit once a month .
