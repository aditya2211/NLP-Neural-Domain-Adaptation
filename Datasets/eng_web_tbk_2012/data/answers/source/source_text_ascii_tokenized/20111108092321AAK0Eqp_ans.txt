<en=4>It depends on if you ever registered the birth .
<en=5>Some places do the registration right at the hospital .... in some smaller places , you need to register your child 's birth at the town hall / registrar 's office .
<en=6>My first three children were born in Southern Ontario cities .
<en=7>The birth registration was done right in hospital .
<en=8>My last son , was born in Northern Ontario ....
<en=9>I did n't know that I did n't register him in the ridiculous amount of paperwork I had filled out in the hospital and was supposed to go to city hall within 90 days .
<en=10>Two years later when I got around to filling for his birth certificate , I find out he was never registered .
<en=11>I had to call the Office of the Registrar General in Thunder Bay , have copies of the delayed registration form mailed out to me , as they do n't have an online area for it yet , fill those out , send them away , then apply for his birth certificate .
<en=12>If you are just applying for a birth certificate for the first time , it s simple to do it over the computer .
<en=13>For $ 56 you can even have it expedited and will get in three business days or your money back .
<en=14>This is in Ontario of course , the rates may be slightly different for other provinces / territories .
<en=15>You just need basic information , and answer a few questions like what hospital was the child born at / who was the doctor ....
<en=16>None , just walk in to the service office and present all the identification you have to prove your identity .
<en=17>they may then chose to ask you to bring more evidence , or just look up the record and hand you the certificate .
<en=18>You can probably do it all on - line .
<en=19>Start here if you were born in Ontario .

<en=21>If you were born elsewhere , start here .

<en=23>Good luck
<en=24>My parents did n't send for my birth certificate until I was 16 and needed it for summer employment .
<en=25>It was no problem to get PROVIDED the birth was registered in the first place .
<en=26>I add that in because there have been some people who have tried to claim citizenship by sending for their birth certificate when they were never really born in Canada or to Canadian parents .
<en=27>When a child is born in Canada the birth is registered before the baby can leave the hospital .
<en=28>As long as that was done you can send for it at any time .
<en=29>Each provincial government has a website that lists the process for that Province so depending upon where you were born you can google it .
