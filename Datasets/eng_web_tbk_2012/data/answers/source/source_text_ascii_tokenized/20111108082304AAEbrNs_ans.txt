<en=1>NOOK Color or NOOK Tablet ?
<en=2>From what I understand they 're pretty much the same thing .
<en=3>Some of the major differences I see is the HD video , longer battery life , and faster processor that the NOOK Tablet boasts .
<en=4>Does the Tablet have a major difference in speed compared to the Color ?
<en=5>I do n't want an iPad or Kindle .
<en=6>I just want an e-reader that does a little bit more than just read .
<en=7>Yes , I know about the Kindle Fire but that 's not what I want (: Does it make sense to shell out the extra fifty dollars ?
<en=8>Or just purchase the Color ?
<en=9>Well I recently bought the Nook Color , and I have to say that I am very happy with it .
<en=10>It is like a mini tablet itself !
<en=11>When I found out them came up with the Nook Tablet , I was pretty disappointed though , because I bought my Nook color for the same darn price !
<en=12>So I say you should go for the more updated Nook Tablet .
<en=13>I 'm pretty sure it 'll be worth it .
<en=14>Have fun !
<en=15>Judging by Nook Tablet 's processor it 's supposed to be quite faster !
<en=16>Basically Nook Tablet it has more memory , better battery life and a better processor and a microphone .
