<en=1>where can I find the best tours to the Mekong Delta at reasonable prices ?
<en=2>will only be in Ho chi Minh for 4 days and I am looking for a 1 day or 2 day trip to Mekong delta .
<en=3>I have been researching on line and find things are quite pricey but the tours look great .
<en=4>Should I just settle and book on line ?
<en=5>or is it better if I wait till I get there ?
<en=6>If I wait , would the tours I find there for less money be the same quality type tours ?
<en=7>Also , any tour recommendations would be very helpful a well .
<en=8>Thank you !
<en=9>If you want reliable and inexpensive ... try Sinh Cafe / Tourist .
<en=10>The are located right at 248 De Than St. in the heart of the back packer district .
<en=11>I have taken this tour and it was great .
<en=12>I did an overnight in a home stay that was sweet and the water market was wonderful .
<en=13>I do n't remember the exact cost but remember thinking how inexpensive it was .
<en=14>Also , Sinh Cafe has been around for a long time and is very reputable .
<en=15>And no , I do not work for them . :)
<en=16>I am just a satisfied customer .
<en=17>And do n't expect to party on this tour .
<en=18>The south is not like the regular tourist towns .
<en=19>Very few clubs and night activities .
<en=20>Oh , if you are confused .
<en=21>Sinh Cafe is not a Cafe .
<en=22>It is a tour agency and they have their own buses etc .

<en=24>have fun .
<en=25>There is n't much to see in the delta , it 's a lifestyle not a resort area .
<en=26>If you 're adventurous you can take a bus or water taxi to My Tho ( near where we live ) or Can Tho .
<en=27>From either of those cities , you can venture out and spend a day in the country .
<en=28>Most of the tourists that I 've come across buy tours along the My Tho waterfront .
<en=29>You take a boat across the river , then spend a day biking , eating at a local restaurant , buying souvenirs and doing other things that are geared towards tourists .
<en=30>The countryside is very beautiful , especially if you have a few months ( or years ) to get to know the place .
<en=31>PS , If you make it to Thanh Pho Ben Tre , stay a night at my friend Ken 's hotel .
<en=32>It 's called Kiwi Heaven and it 's across the river from Cho Ben Tre .
<en=33>It 's a little hard to get to by foot , they 're rebuilding the bridge , but you can get someone to moto - taxi you there for a dollar or less .
<en=34>He 's an ex-pat from New Zealand and he 's been in town for awhile .
<en=35>He 'll set up a real tour of the area for you , not some tourist fantasy .
<en=36>Have a good trip where - ever you end up .
<en=37>We went with Intrepid as a part of their North to South Vietnam Trip , but they do offer this one day separately .
<en=38>We had a great time and visited a location where they made coconut candies , visited a local restaurant which was attached to a fish farm , rode in modified quad bikes and had some tropical food at what appeared to be a local hangout .
<en=39>Intrepid is good at getting you away from the most touristy spots and showing you something a little different .
