<en=1>How do I take care of my newborn baby fish ?
<en=2>I am nervous that my other fish will eat them , and I do n't know what to feed them !
<en=3>I have counted around 25 of them and they currently reside in a 20 gallon tank .
<en=4>You could move all the babies into a fry net breeder or move all of the bigger fish ( also the parents ) to a different tank to avoid the babies getting eaten .
<en=5>Feed the babies 3 - 4 times a day with flakes .
<en=6>Provide plenty of hiding places like rocks , plants , etc in the tank .
<en=7>It s natural for some babies to be eaten by adults and if all of them survived your tank would be very overcrowded .
<en=8>Look in the pet stores for " fry food " or " baby fish foods " .
<en=9>what kind of newborn fish you have ?
<en=10>some parents would not eat there fish till a certain age jack dempsey for example would not eat there offspring till they mature but i would move the baby fish into a smaller tank and feed them flakes
