<en=1>How to convince my parents to let me get a Ball python ?
<en=2>They do n't know ANYTHING about Ball pythons .
<en=3>When I ask my mom she says she will never let a snake in her house .
<en=4>She has no experience with snakes and has never held one .
<en=5>I did all my research and am well prepared to keep one , I 'm 14 by the way
<en=6>Lay some knowledge on them dude .
<en=7>Maybe if they see how much time and effort you 've devoted to researching the animal they 'll reconsider .
<en=8>Tell them it costs like 8 dollars a month ( if even that much ) to keep it fed .
<en=9>Be helpful around the house to show that even if you ca n't pay for it yourself that you re willing to work for it .
<en=10>Once you 've buttered them up a bit try to get them to the pet store and ask one of the employees to handle the snake showing your mom how gentle and harmless they can be .
<en=11>Maybe even try to get your mom to hold it a bit .
<en=12>My wife was TERRIFIED of snakes when we first met , I introduced her to one out my baby corn snakes and she fell in love with it .
<en=13>Be persistent , but do n't pester them about it cause that 'll get you nowhere fast .
<en=14>Good luck !
<en=15>My general convince your parents to let you get a reptile advice :
<en=16>1 . Be responsible .
<en=17>Do all your chores without being nagged , take care of any existing pets , keep your room clean , and so on .
<en=18>Prove , to your parents ' satisfaction , that you , not they , will be the one actually taking care of your new pet .
<en=19>2 . Save up , and research , so that you are ready for your new pet .
<en=20>3 . Bargain with them .
<en=21>Offer to do extra chores , ask for your pet as a reward for good grades , something like that .
<en=22>4 . Play the sympathy card .
<en=23>If you can find a pet at a shelter , or that a friend needs to get rid of because they 're moving or whatever , you might be able to talk your parents into " giving it a good home " where you might not be able to talk them into buying a new pet .
<en=24>On the fear angle -- talk her into coming to the pet store with you .
<en=25>Once you 're there , ask if you can hold a ball python .
<en=26>Once you 're holding it , try to get her to touch / pet it ...
