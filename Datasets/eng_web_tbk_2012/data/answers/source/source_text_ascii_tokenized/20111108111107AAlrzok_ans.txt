<en=1>How to train my puppy ?
<en=2>I have a 4 months Shih Tzu puppy .
<en=3>Recently I 'm having trouble training him .
<en=4>He is kind of hate walking with leash , every time I put the leash on , he will try to bite it .
<en=5>And he is not following me when I was walking .
<en=6>I saw lots of videos about this , but actually it did n't help .
<en=7>Is there any way can let him know how to walk with leash ?
<en=8>And every time he see some one he will rush to people and jump on them , does n't listen to me .
<en=9>He is really excited about anybody he see .
<en=10>How to prevent this ?
<en=11>Last thing is every time I sit on a chair or something higher than him , he will try to jump on , if he ca n't , he will bark all the time until I let him get on , what should I do with this ?
<en=12>Anyone have any suggestion ?
<en=13>thank you very much .
<en=14>Hi , I am a dog trainer for 25 yrs .
<en=15>You need to purchase what is called a shoulder point harness .
<en=16>This type of harness goes around the dog s chest and legs and has a clip for the leash up on the back of the dog in middle of shoulder blades .
<en=17>This way , he can not reach the leash to chew it .
<en=18>When he swivels his head to go for it anyway , tell him sharp " UH UH " gently correct him with a small tug and continue your walk .
<en=19>Do this repeatedly and frequently and he will learn to walk on a leash .
<en=20>Patience is the key here .
<en=21>He is a young pup and will learn over time and consistency in his training .
<en=22>And always , always train with love and positive methods - never hit or harshly scold .
<en=23>Never train out of fear .
<en=24>You want your dog to admire you as his pack leader , not fear you .
<en=25>Good luck with your puppy !
<en=26>All the best .
<en=27>Put him in dog obedience school or call a professional dog trainer . :)
<en=28>why do nt you get some treats that he loves and only give him them when he does something right .
<en=29>or , as i saw on embarrassing pets on tv , get a clicker type thing and treats as well .
<en=30>try to train him to heel , which means to walk round you before he needs to go on a leash , and he may do that .
<en=31>or you could even spray some scented spray on the leash and he will go for the scent and probably , if you act quick enough , will stay on the leash .
