<en=1>Dwarf Hamster Making Too Much Noise On Wheel at Night ?
<en=2>I 'm getting a dwarf Hamster tomorrow And i was just talking to my Mom and she said that we have to take out the wheel at night because it would disturb her sleep But i told her no because i said thei r energetic at night at my room is right next door to hers But i heard their are wheels that do nt make noise at all what would be the price of it ?
<en=3>I 'm quite sure , you do n't even have to buy another , all you need to do , is to pour some oil on the wheel , or even put some rubber on it's edges , the part that is making the noise .
<en=4>That might work

<en=7>works well lasts long .
<en=8>I have a dwarf hamster who HATES his wheel and does n't use it -
<en=9>he makes so much MORE noise , as he plays and digs and jumps ( seriously )
<en=10>wheels are relatively noiseless -
<en=11>a few squeaks from a wheel are better than the full wrath of a bored pet !
