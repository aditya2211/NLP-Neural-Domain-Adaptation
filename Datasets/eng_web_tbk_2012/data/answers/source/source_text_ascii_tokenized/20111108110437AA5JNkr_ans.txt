<en=1>what is a kimberwick bit used for ?
<en=2>Used as a help for horses that are quite strong pullers while hacking , hunting and doing cross country .
<en=3>It is a curb bit with a ported mouth piece and some horses appreciate this to give them more room in their mouths for their tongues .
<en=4>It is not as precise as a pelham bit because it only uses one rein , though the modern ones have two or three slots on which to put the reins .
<en=5>The lower the reins , the stronger the action and the lower the reins the stronger the action on the poll too .
<en=6>Useful for younger kids who do not have big enough hands or the ability to handle two reins independently .
<en=7>For horses that are strong pullers .
<en=8>It just gives you a little leverage and curb pressure .
<en=9>It 's nice for horses that need a little more than a snaffle .
<en=10>I know that 's vague , but it depends on the horse .
<en=11>The rider needs to have independent hands as well , because you do NOT want to pull too hard on a bit like that . ;)
