<en=2>i want to buy a laptop for my girlfriend in ireland , would she be able to just use the dongle she uses for her pc and put it straight in the laptop and it work like normall ?
<en=3>thanks people
<en=4>Yes obviously the USB is region free which means you can use it anywhere .
<en=5>And every computer manufactured in both Ireland & the UK are Region 2 aka PAL .
<en=6>There wo n't be a difference since mobile broadband is supposed to be digital .
<en=7>But word of advice if you 're get your girlfriend a laptop make sure it s a good brand a not something like DELL , Acer , Asus , eMachines etc .
<en=8>just a heads up .
<en=9>yes of course you can ....
<en=10>I have many friends that have laptops bought in the UK that use them here
<en=11>If in dongle you mean USB stick then yes USB sticks are the same any were you go :) hope that answered your question .
