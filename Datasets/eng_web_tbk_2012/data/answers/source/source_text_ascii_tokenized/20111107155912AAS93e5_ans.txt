<en=10>Carnival and Royal Caribbean are two popular cruise lines that have strong followings .
<en=11>Some cruise aficionados refuse to sail on one or the other .
<en=12>Are there any major differences between them ?
<en=13>Explore which cruise may fit your needs the best .
<en=14>For our comparison we sailed on two similar ships - the Carnival Liberty and the Royal Caribbean Mariner of the Seas .
<en=15>Itinerary Both ships go to Caribbean Islands like Jamaica , Grand Cayman , Cozumel , St. Thomas , the Bahamas and St. Martin / St. Maarten .
<en=16>The Liberty also visited its private island Half Moon Cay , Puerto Rico , and Grand Turk .
<en=17>The Mariner of the Seas traveled to its private island Coco Cay and Labadee ( the north coast of Haiti ) .
<en=18>We loved most of the locations that both of the ships visited and do n't believe that this should be a distinguishing factor on deciding between the cruise lines .
<en=19>Shows Each night there are a variety of shows .
<en=20>Usually you have the main show and some type of entertainment before and perhaps afterward .
<en=21>We felt that the main shows on the Mariner of the Seas were better .
<en=22>On the Liberty we liked the comedian and juggling act .
<en=23>If you love seeing the shows , Royal Caribbean was better for the main shows and Carnival was slightly better for the comedians .
<en=24>Dining Room We enjoyed the atmosphere of both dining rooms on the Liberty and Mariner of the Seas .
<en=25>We felt that the menu had a little more variety on the Mariner of the Seas .
<en=26>Friendliness of staff The Liberty and Mariner of the Seas both get high grades .
<en=27>We did have one waiter that complained some on one of our trips on the Mariner .
<en=28>We had a slightly better experience on the Liberty , but feel that both crews did an excellent job and that this should not be a distinguishing factor on choosing a cruise .
<en=29>Pools The Mariner of the Seas and Liberty both had salt water pools - which most cruise ships have .
<en=30>They both had pools for kids and adults .
<en=31>We liked the Liberty 's pools better because one had a slide .
<en=32>If you have kids , this would be something that they would definitely enjoy .
<en=33>Spa We tried the spa on the Liberty and loved it .
<en=34>We did not try the spa on the Mariner of the Seas .
<en=35>Usually you ca n't go wrong when getting a spa treatment ......
<en=36>Royal Caribbean is better , but the best cruiseline is Regent Seven Seas .
<en=37>Look on their website rssc.com
<en=38>Royal Caribbean .
<en=39>Carnival has been called the WalMart of cruise lines ...
