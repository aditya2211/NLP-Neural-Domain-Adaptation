<en=1>What is the best place to get discounts for San Francisco restaurants ?
<en=2>I just moved into the city , and I 'm wondering if there 's a place I can get good deals on restaurants here .
<en=3>I do n't want to have to deal with those deal - a - day websites like Groupon .
<en=4>I just want a simple way to get a good deal to whatever Restaurant I want , whenever I want .
<en=5>Any suggestions would be really helpful , thanks !
<en=6>I usually use ZebraKlub .
<en=7>They basically buy daily deals from Groupon , Living Social , and all sorts of other places .
<en=8>So you can pretty much get whatever deal you want anytime .
<en=9>Most of the deals let you eat for 500 ff , and some of the deals are even free .
<en=10>If you want to eat cheaply without worrying about all those daily deal emails every day , ZebraKlub should be perfect for you .
