<en=1>When is the best time to travel to Ireland ?
<en=2>My sister and I would like to go to Ireland .
<en=3>I graduate in the spring , and so we 'd like to go between then and winter .
<en=4>We do n't want too many tourists , and since we 'll both be out of school we can go anytime between the middle of June to early November .
<en=5>We do n't want it to be too cold ( not sure when exactly there fall is ... or what the weather is really like there during our autumn months ) , but we do n't feel like we need to go right in the middle of summer either .
<en=6>We 're both in our early 20s and just wanting to explore the beautiful country while we 're still young and before our lives start to get even crazier !
<en=7>Can anyone give me an idea of when the best time for us to go to Ireland would be ?
<en=8>People do not go to Ireland on holiday for the weather , it is unpredictable .
<en=9>One thing you can be sure of about Irish weather is how little you can be sure of .
<en=10>It may be shirtsleeves and sunglasses in February , but winter woollies in March and even during the summer .
<en=11>And then there 's the rain .
<en=12>Ireland receives a lot of rain , with certain areas getting a soaking as many as 270 days of the year .
<en=13>County Kerry is the worst affected .
<en=14>The southeast is the driest , enjoying a more continental climate .
<en=15>The Irish weather works on the ' four seasons in a day ' principle , which basic ally means that you ca n't predict a thing when it comes to the behaviour of the sky .
<en=16>Some basic assumptions , however , can be made .
<en=17>In summer , from May to July , the days are reasonably warm and - most importantly - very long : at the height of summer you wo n't need to turn on lights until after 10 pm .
<en=18>It is also peak tourist season , which means there are far more people just about everywhere but the most remote corners of the island , and prices are at their highest .
<en=19>Not surprisingly , most of the yearly festivals occur during these times so as to take advantage of the crowds and the more favourable weather .
<en=20>Spring ( February to April ) and Autumn ( August to October ) make good alternatives , although the country 's ever - growing popularity as a tourist destination can often blur the lines between mid - and high - season tourism .
<en=21>Still , you have a better chance of some peace and quiet , and the weather can be surprisingly better in April and September than in mid-July - again , it 's all part of the uncertainty principle .
<en=22>Spring festivities include the ever - popular St Patrick 's Festival .
<en=23>Although temperatures do not often venture below freezing , winter ( December to February ) can be brutal , for huge parts of the country - the west and northwest in particular .
<en=24>Crowds are at their thinnest , but many of the country 's tourist attractions and services close down in October and do n't reopen until Easter , which paradoxically leaves visitors with a more convincing taste of how Ireland is experienced by most of the Irish : it 's cold , grey and dark by 5 pm , but there 's always a pub to escape into when the rain starts sheeting down .
<en=25>The thing to do is to bring the right clothing with you , clothes so you can layer up if it is cold and take off layers when it warms up .
<en=26>Waterproof clothing and footwear are essential plus an umbrella ..
<en=27>As that famous Scotsman Billy Connolly says " there is no such thing as bad weather just the wrong clothes "
<en=28>Afraid I can not be more helpful , it is really a case of pot luck , although as the weather is so changeable often a cold wet morning will turn into a lovely warm sunny afternoon and evening or visa versa .
<en=29>If you mean the Republic of Ireland ( Dublin ) then anytime .
<en=30>The summer there is much more mild than most of the US ( are you coming from the US ? ) .
<en=31>Their seasons are the same as all the countries in the Northern Hemisphere but I would suggest fall .
<en=32>It does get pretty cold in Ireland so going before winter is your best bet .
<en=33>September for example .
<en=34>Rent a car and spend a couple days outside of Dublin seeing the countryside and you will have the trip of a lifetime .
<en=35>To explore the beautiful countryside you will need to be old enough to hire a car because public transport is expensive & only goes as far as the main towns / cities , most rural places do n't have a bus or train service .
<en=36>You could stay in a city & get a bus tour to say the Cliffs of Moher or Dingle peninsula but you will be with all the other tourists .
<en=37>By definition most tourists will go to the best places so you might have to put up with a few tourists along the way .
<en=38>Best weather the past couple of years has been around late April - late May but it can pour with rain for days on end at any time of the year so be prepared with waterproof jackets / boots etc .
<en=39>We only had a few sunny days this summer , barely 24 C on a few occasions , more like 14 C most days .
<en=40>We used our BBQ on precisely 4 occasions .
<en=41>Autumn is from mid August onwards as far as the weather goes if not officially according to the calender .
<en=42>The days start to shorten & it gets even wetter , windier & colder .
<en=43>We had frosts in October so I would n't advise visiting late in the year to be honest , Spring time is your best bet .
<en=44>You do realise it is quite expensive to visit Ireland ?
<en=45>You are going to need a few thousand dollars saved up for flights , insurance , food , accommodation & spending money .
<en=46>Eating out in particular is quite expensive compared to America I believe .
