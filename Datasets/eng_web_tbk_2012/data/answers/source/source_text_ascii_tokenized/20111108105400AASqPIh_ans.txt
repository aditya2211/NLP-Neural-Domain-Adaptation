<en=3>Only a fool would base a decision using the cheapest surgeon to perform an operation .
<en=4>Cheapest surgeons work out of some small clinic and do not have the skills you are looking for . .
<en=5>Do you really want to put your faith in some clinic doctor .
<en=6>I know I would n't .
<en=7>You need to check with one of the major hospital that performance this procedure like Bumrungard Hospital or Yanhee Hospital .
<en=8>Would you choose the cheapest brakes for your expensive race car or maybe the cheapest parachute too ?
<en=9>Sometimes the " cheap " comes expensive !
<en=10>When you have invasive surgery you could also get infections , accidental nicks and cuts that cause other problems too !
<en=11>If they screw up you could be in worse shape than you are now !
<en=12>Bumrungrad Hospital does some good work but all hospitals do have their problems from time to time .
<en=13>Maybe having an experienced doctor might be better than some guy that is cheaper but less experienced !
