<en=1>How Do you Prevent A Dwarf Hamster Escaping From The Cage ?
<en=2>I m getting a dwarf hamster tomorrow and i saw videos on youtube of them escaping and if my hamster escaped because my mom will FREAK OUT !!!
<en=3>would it help getting an aquarium cage or a plastic see through box so it ca nt escape i can buy it a wheel
<en=4>I 've never had a dwarf hamster but I 've had the same problem with my pet rat I put some chicken wiring around it the I got from home depot and now it ca n't out .
<en=5>Yes I 've had 53 different kinds of rodents and two were dwarf hamsters they flatten into a pancake and slide right through the bars and are able to open the door so yes a plastic cage will be good

<en=9>I love this cage , it 's easy to clean , very spacious and fun for the hamster
<en=10>Aquiriums are good also , but provide a mesh top for an easy airway .
<en=11>Wire cages are NOT acceptable for dwarfs really , unless the bars have less than half a cm between them .
<en=12>regards and have fun with your hammy
