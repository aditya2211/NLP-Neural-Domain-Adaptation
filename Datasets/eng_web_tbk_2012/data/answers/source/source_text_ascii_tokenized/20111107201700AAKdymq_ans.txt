<en=1>Is it better to book a cruise online or by a travel agent ?
<en=2>First time to go on A cruise any and all info is appreciated
<en=3>Personally , I do n't find a travel agent to be of value to me as I am willing to put in the time doing research on the internet .
<en=4>I have not had good experience with travel agents .
<en=5>They do n't seem to know anything but the hype they are told and the packages they have available to them .
<en=6>The one time I actually booked through a travel agent I did not get all of the amenities I had paid for .
<en=7>The few times I have consulted with a travel agent I was able to find the same for less on my own , and more options than what they were selling .
<en=8>So now I do not bother with them at all .
<en=9>best is using an online travel agent
