<en=1>Gaining and loosing my cockatiel 's trust ... ?
<en=2>I thought that I had gained my cockatiel 's trust , but now he 's not coming to me when I open his cage .
<en=3>What do I do ?
<en=4>Did anything happen before losing his trust ?
<en=5>Birds are hard to gain trust with , but it 's lost so easily !
<en=6>A simple hand gesture could have resorted to him being afraid of you .
<en=7>Eating by his cage and keeping a " sleep cage " in your room is a good idea .
<en=8>Birds eat and sleep with their flock , not predators .
<en=9>Keep his cage open and go on your computer , or read a book , etc and maybe he will come out to you .
<en=10>Let him go at his own pace , do n't rush with him , and never ever resort to physical violence with your bird .
<en=11>This with ruin your bond , and you probably wo n't have another chance to build one .
<en=12>Patience is the key . =)
<en=13>he might never be a cuddly , loving , tame bird , but you can still have a friendly bond .
<en=14>But then again he could be !
<en=15>dat bird is smart .
<en=16>like my dogs , they really like me and trust me , but when I open the door to get them outside , they run from me , they know I 'm going to take them outside and they do n't like it .
<en=17>the bird must know that when you open the cage door it means that you will put him in the cage , and birds do n't usually like cages .
<en=18>so , I do n't think the bird do n't trust you , but still do n't like the cage .
