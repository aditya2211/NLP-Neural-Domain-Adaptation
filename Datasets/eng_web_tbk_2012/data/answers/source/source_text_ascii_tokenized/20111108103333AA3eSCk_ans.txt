<en=1>Can I text from Canada to the united states ?
<en=2>Ok maybe that is n't the right question , but my question is can you text from a united states number when you r in canada , can you send texts to another united states number ?
<en=3>And do you get charged for it ?
<en=4>I m sorry if I could n't say the question right .
<en=5>I hope somebody understands what I mean
<en=6>In short Yes .
<en=7>However not in all cases .
<en=8>If your ( US ) provider has a deal with a canadian wireless company , you texts and calls will go through .
<en=9>They will , however , cost a bunch .
<en=10>The only way to know for sure is to call 611 , or your cell phone help line , and ask .
<en=11>The phones and networks are compatible , so the only reason it would n't work would be if you have , say , a cheap cell phone company ..
<en=12>Yes you can , but it will cost you lots of money unless you have an international plan .
<en=13>Ye$ you can Text in CANADA to the U$ on a U$ number .
<en=14>Thi$ $ervice will co$t .
<en=15>It varie$ company to company .
<en=16>You may want to get a temporary phone for your trip to Canada .
<en=17>Is there any other way to communicate or do your friends only understand text .
<en=18>Email usually free if you use a WiFi connection .
<en=19>$ometime$ it is hard to explain that you are making an INTERNATIONAL call and all of the phone companie $involved what $ome of your money .
<en=20>Hope you unde$tood the me$$age I do have an " S " key on my computer .
