<en=1>Name of specific Hibachi restaurant in Chicago ?
<en=2>I have a friend out in Chicago this week , and I am trying to remember the name of an awesome hibachi style restaurant i visited while out there a couple years ago .
<en=3>I think it was in the Lincoln Square area but do n't quote me on that .
<en=4>It's ' gimmick ' was that you fill your bowl cafeteria - style from raw ingredients and leave it on the counter with a chopstick listing your table number on it .
<en=5>Four guys around a large square open hibachi cook your food , and when it 's finished a server brings it to your table .
<en=6>All - you can - eat style deal .
<en=7>It was pretty epic as I remember and would love to send my friend there .
<en=8>Any help ?
<en=9>That is Flat Top Grill
