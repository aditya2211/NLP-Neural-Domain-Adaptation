<en=6>I would say it really depends on your riding ability , what disciplines you are interested in doing , or plan on doing , etc .
<en=7>But I would go for the base number of 15 hh .
<en=8>It 's " tall " being it 's bigger than a pony , but it 's on the small end for a horse .
<en=9>I got my horse when I was 12 and I was already 5 ' 9 - 5 ' 10 , thankfully I stopped growing when I hit 5 ' 11 " but my horse is about 16.2 or 16.3 hh , TB .
<en=10>So do n't be afraid to get something a little bigger than " perfect " just in case you hit a growth spurt .
<en=11>A taller horse does n't always mean a horse you ca n't handle .
<en=12>Keep that in mind .
<en=13>Also keep in mind whether you want to be able to jump up from the ground , if you even need to , etc .
<en=14>You just want to be sure you can groom and saddle sufficiently and the horse itself is calm enough so that whatever size it is , you can handle it .
<en=15>i 'm 5 ' 3 - 4 " and am 21 well will be in Nov and my horse is 14.2 hh and she 's perfect size for me i can hop right on with no mounting block ..... only with a saddle though haha i ca n't bareback , not yet
<en=16>If you Do n't want to grow out of it quickly get a 14 ' 2 ..
<en=17>Anything smaller you will grow out , anything bigger will be too big and difficult to control and manage , especially when riding .
<en=18>Hope I helped :)
