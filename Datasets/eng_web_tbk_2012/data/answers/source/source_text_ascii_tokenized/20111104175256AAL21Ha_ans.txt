<en=1>Was the San Francisco Bay Area mostly Caucasian back in the early 1970s ?
<en=2>No .

<en=4>The whole Western Addition and a large portion of the Haight was black .
<en=5>The Mission was basically latin - american .
<en=6>As the southeast asians and philipinos came over , they added to the cultures .
<en=7>So , the Bay Area has been fairly mixed ethnically for a long time -- caucasians may have seemed to be a large populous but that 's because most tourists back then were caucasian and many of the hippies were caucasians so that 's who the photographers took pictures of .
<en=8>The other ethicities were n't well represented in politics yet -- or rather , they were just breaking the color barrier in the 70's due largely to the more open - minded hippy generation .
<en=9>Marin County was predominantly caucasian and many of the expanding outer east bay areas started out as white suburbs .

<en=16>We had fewer social benefits at that time for people so many immigrants were not counted .
<en=17>Only Caucasians had any political power , corporate presence or owned businesses except for Mom and Pop stores in some neighborhoods .
<en=18>San Francisco was settled in the 19th and 20th century by mainly European immigrants except for some Asian workers who were manual laborers .
<en=19>There has always been a Mexican - American cultural influence since Calif was owned by Mexico .
<en=20>We had a larger black population in the 70s than we have now but they did not have any power until Willie Brown was elected .
