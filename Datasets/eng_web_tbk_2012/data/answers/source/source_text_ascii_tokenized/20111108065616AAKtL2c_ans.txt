<en=7>It is vacation time .
<en=8>Many families are set to plan a best holidaying .
<en=9>They look for fun filled , rejuvenating and memorable vacation .
<en=10>There can be many ideas ; one can see numerous options passing through their mind .
<en=11>What is the best option ?
<en=12>Especially if you are planning to spend couple days with family and kids , which best suit you can select ?
<en=13>Disney cruises , is a simple answer to this .
<en=14>There are many reasons to say Disney cruise is the best bet for you to have a enjoyable holiday tour .
<en=15>From 1998 onwards , from its inception Disney cruise has attracted many and continue to attract more and more .
<en=16>This is a spectacular ship , a very popular choice of families to spend their leisure time .
<en=17>The ship is designed thematically , with imposing animated cartoon characters .
<en=18>Do you feel that the holidaying with the animated cartoons will impress only young ones ?
<en=19>No , the luxurious facilities and fun filled activities in the Disney cruise are very attractive to people of all ages .
<en=20>Whatever be the age , you will have the choice of variety of activities to forget about your hectic day - to - day activities .
<en=21>Kids fun games and video shows are added to the other facilities .
<en=22>There are two ships , Disney magic and Disney wonder .
<en=23>Both are made keeping in mind the comforts of the travelers .
<en=24>Disney cruises offer 24 - hour room services , and the crews are ready to serve you the way you like .
<en=25>It has got very spacious rooms , furnished completely and neatly .
<en=26>These are decorated uniquely and marvelously .
<en=27>The ship offers variety of eatables , deliciously made .
<en=28>Sea fishes , prawns and many nice options are there in different restaurants aboard .
<en=29>There are many good options of delicious food on the shores as well .
<en=30>There are special regions uniquely and imposingly designed for the children .
<en=31>They can spend many hours enjoying the Disney world magic .
<en=32>These theme parks have all types of facilities .
<en=33>Video shows , cartoon stories , wonderful games and many such facilities .
<en=34>It is really an entertainment for the kids .
<en=35>The amusing world of cartoons and stories will be a memorable experience for the children .
<en=36>There are other amnesties also .
<en=37>These include space for dances and music , bar facility , gambling facilities for the elder , spaciously made open area aboard and many such nice facilities .
<en=38>Also one can keep their privacy in the cabins and make the time in seclusion .
<en=39>To relax and to rejuvenate Disney cruise are the best option .
<en=40>There are many online sites offering the booking facility with affordable rates .
<en=41>You can select the proper route and travel plans by consulting the agents prior to the booking ........
<en=42>Off season is good , however , the Disney cruises are almost ALWAYS completely booked .
<en=43>I would suggest a warmer season , but not Spring Break or early summer .
<en=44>You may also want to avoid Thanksgiving week and the Christmas holidays .
<en=45>We REALLY enjoyed our balcony -- coffee in the mornings , drinks at night , standing outside when docking and leaving port -- however , it is quite a bit more expensive .
<en=46>With young ones , I would definitely get a window or view room so they can see outside .
<en=47>Check out the kids ' space as soon as you get onboard .
<en=48>Do NOT feel guilty about taking them there .
<en=49>They have a BLAST so the sooner they get there , the sooner they can have fun .
<en=50>We liked getting the late dinner seating , so you have more time to see movies and stuff but if your kids are ' early to bed ' you may want the earlier seating for dinners .
<en=51>Bring some sort of magnet or small magnetic whiteboard for your door .
<en=52>All of the doors tend to look alike and having ' something ' on your door helps you and your kids find your room easier .
<en=53>You can also leave notes for the rest of your family ( husband ) about where you are at any given point .
<en=54>Cell phones do NOT work on board but they give you a ' walkie - talkie ' kind of phone in your room that WILL work onboard .
<en=55>Each evening you will get a ' magazine ' called The Navigator which lists all of the activities for the next day .
<en=56>We always took ours to dinner and discussed what things we felt we ' had ' to do and which ones we felt like skipping in lieu of just chilling .
<en=57>Any time would be great .
<en=58>off season cruises might actually be better with preschoolers as prices might be lower in the off season .
<en=59>My wife and I , in our 60's at the time , originally planned a 3 generation trip but some family emergencies caused everyone else to cancel .
<en=60>We had a ball .
<en=61>We had an inside cabin and it is what I would recommend .
<en=62>There are so many things to do that you will only use your room for sleeping and the extra cost of the balcony is wasted .
<en=63>The children can be checked in and checked out in a safe way at many activities so you can have a bit of free time without the little ones .
<en=64>The range of activities can be illustrated by describing the water activities .
<en=65>There is a splash fountain ( no standing water ) for little ones still in diapers ; Next is a wading pool for those who are potty trained ; Then a family pool ; Finally there is a pool for adults only with kids not allowed .
<en=66>You will never be so spoiled in your life as you are on a Disney Cruise .
<en=67>If you stay with your dining schedule , every night is dinner and a show .
<en=68>The real payoff is that you will have the same waiter for the entire cruise .
<en=69>Our waiter quickly grasped the fact that I like Ginger ale and rather spicy foods while my wife 's taste ran to lemonade and less spicy fare .
<en=70>Since they knew our preferences , we almost always went along with their menu suggestions and were never sorry we did .
<en=71>Obviously they had a full beverage list including alcohol for adults who wanted it .
<en=72>If you should miss a meal , you also missed a great show .
<en=73>but food is always available and it is consistently good .
<en=74>I think I gained three pounds in my week long cruise .
