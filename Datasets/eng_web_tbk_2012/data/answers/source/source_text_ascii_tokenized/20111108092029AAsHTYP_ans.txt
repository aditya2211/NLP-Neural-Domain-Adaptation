<en=1>What would you get if you cross a sussex male and a silkie female ?
<en=2>i had a sussex male and a pekin female i bought 2 silkies what would the sussex female and the silkie females would make ?
<en=3>if you had any pics of your hens i would like to see them to compare them to mine thanks ?
<en=4>A Sussex crossed with Silkie would make a crossbred * mutt * chicken .
<en=5>There are a lot of genetics at play between a Sussex and Silkie , so the offspring would vary in appearance .
<en=6>You do n't say what color Silkie or Sussex you are dealing with so I ca n't say what color your chicks would be likely to be .
<en=7>However , I can say what features they would / could have .
<en=8>Feather Type .
<en=9>Silkies have hookless feathers .
<en=10>Sussexs have soft feathers .
<en=11>All offspring from this cross will have soft feathers , as hookless feathers are a recessive gene .
<en=12>Skin Color : Silkies have black skin color , which is dominate .
<en=13>Sussex have White Skin which could be recessive or dominate .
<en=14>Either way rec. and dom. white genes dilute the black gene .
<en=15>Skin will be darker but lighter then the Silkies .
<en=16>Beards / Muffs : If your Silkie has a beard / muff the offspring could have a beard as well , as these genes are incomplete dominate .
<en=17>Feathered Feet / Shanks - Chicks could have feathered feet / shanks as this is also incomplete dominate .
<en=18>Crest : Chicks could also develop a small crest due to this being another incomplete dominate gene .
<en=19>Comb Type : Silkies have walnut combs which is actually genetically two comb types ( Rose and Pea ) single is also there , but is recessive .
<en=20>So crossed to a Sussex you could get a walnut , pea , rose , or single combed bird .
<en=21>Five Toes : Silkies have five toes .
<en=22>Sussex have four toes .
<en=23>Crossed together ( five toes is incompletely dominate ) chicks could develop to have an fifth toe on both , or even one foot .
<en=24>Silkie crosses are great birds , and very neat looking .
<en=25>Hens make excellent mothers as they are bigger , can see better , and are smarter the Silkies .
<en=26>Best wishes ,
