<en=1>Vietnamese girl 's name , Mayko ?
<en=2>I always thought Mayko or Meiko is a Japanese name .
<en=3>The Canadian Regenesis actress Mayko Nguyen has Japanese connection or is it her fake name ?
<en=4>Right , I could n't find any proven source for that .
<en=5>And her last name , Nguyen is a typical Vietnamese family name ... anyone ?
<en=6>Certainly , Nguyen is the one of first names of many people in Vietnam , only in Vietnam .
<en=7>Mayko is relating to the Japanese .
<en=8>In Vietnam , when a baby was born , they must be named " first name " according to that of their fathers .
<en=9>It 's principle except a number of cases , for example , the babies are orphans or not to have father .
<en=10>E.g .
<en=11>Full name of the father is : " Nguyen Thanh Luan " ===> Full name of the son / daughter certainly is " Nguyen .......... " , for instance , " Nguyen Thi Thuy Lan " .
<en=12>But if the babies were born in American so they would named in other way but still remain " First name " in order to recall about their origination .
<en=13>I 'm pretty sure that Mayko is Japanese .
<en=14>She is a Canadian born Vietnamese .
<en=15>I 'm not sure where her first name is from ...
