<en=3>where would you go ?
<en=4>I have never been anywhere out side my home town Charlotte north Carolina please help !!!!
<en=5>definitely London -
<en=6>you speak the language and will have more fun .
<en=7>The French tend to look down on the Americans and treat them bad .
<en=8>London is a deliteful city to visit and easy to get around .
<en=9>You will be able to have a good time there .
<en=10>%
<en=11>As you 're from the States you 'll have much more fun in London .
<en=12>Parisians dislike Americans for their lack of speaking French and proper French manners .
<en=13>I was told to leave a restaurant because I ordered water with my meal ( apparently this is " washing down " your food " ) and not ordering wine .
<en=14>You 'll need to have intermediate French to have a good time in Paris .
<en=15>However , outside Paris everybody is wonderful .
<en=16>Nobody likes the Parisians , even then Parisians do n't like Parisians .
<en=17>South France is wonderful , right on the Mediterranean .
<en=18>It 's beautiful and the people are extremely friendly .
<en=19>I used to live in London for 6 months and it 's by far one of my favorite places to be in the world ( I 've been to 45 countries in 5 years ) .
<en=20>Everything about the place is magical and the people are mostly friendly .
<en=21>However , if you 're allowed another option and you want a small - town feel , then head to Edinburgh , Scotland .
<en=22>I lived there for 8 months .
<en=23>If your French is good / moderate , then head to Paris without a doubt .
<en=24>I also highly recommend staying with a French family .
<en=25>I did this at age 13 in Champagne , France and it was the most amazing experice of my upbringing .
