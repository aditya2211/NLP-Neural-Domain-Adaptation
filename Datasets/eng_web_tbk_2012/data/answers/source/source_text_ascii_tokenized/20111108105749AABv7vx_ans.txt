<en=1>How do you make your cat adjust to a new house ?
<en=2>Me and my family are moving into a new house just outside a small town .
<en=3>We are currently living a mile from the town in a house surrounded by fields but the new house is beside a busy road .
<en=4>We have had the cat for 10 years and do nt want to leave it .
<en=5>How could we make it settle in a new house .
<en=6>you are not just moving house - your cat is losing his territory .
<en=7>territory is very important to cats , and they are very nervous when they go into a new place - a new house could be full of predators , or unknown menaces - well at least he thinks so .
<en=8>you will need to give him only a small place to explore , so he can make it his territory , and feel safe there .
<en=9>then , he can have a place to retreat to when he feels scared .
<en=10>you will need to get his box and bowls , and whatever blanket and toys are his , and smell like home , and put him in a room .
<en=11>the room you sleep in is best ( seeing you so relaxed that you are sleeping will send the message that everything is OK ) , but others will work just as well .
<en=12>close the door , and keep him in there for a week .
<en=13>he will feel much safer in that one room , than in a huge unknown house .
<en=14>he will explore the room , mark everything with his cheek , and try to make it feel like his territory .
<en=15>he will reassure himself that no other animal is in there , and that no other animal will come in - he is afraid that he is in someone else 's territory when he is in a new house .
<en=16>in a week 's time , he will have made it his , and will be getting more bored than afraid .
<en=17>let him out for half an hour , to explore .
<en=18>then put him back in .
<en=19>he will be freaked out , so going back to his territory will make him much happier .
<en=20>extend the time he is out each day , but for the first month , always put him in his room at night , so he feels safe to sleep .
<en=21>soon he will make the whole house his , but he needs that one safe place to start from .
<en=22>remember to visit with him while he is in the room , and tell him how good he is .
<en=23>remember to give him the time he needs to feel that the room is his - rush it , and he will be afraid of the whole house for a long time .
<en=24>he might even start peeing on things in fear .
<en=25>good luck with your new house and with his new territory !
<en=26>Let her explore when we moved my cat had to explore the entire house before she felt comfortable .
<en=27>In time though she / he will adjust . :)
<en=28>they just do it on their own .
