<en=4>Where in Europe ?

<en=6>How long should I go for to each place ?
<en=7>( I Have 1 year before collage ! )
<en=8>& Also how much money would I need ?
<en=9>So I can start saving now hehe
<en=10>Thanks :)
<en=11>I mean when I graduate & yes , college , sorry for the typo .
<en=12>Leave High School ?
<en=13>Not the smartest move to take off on a worldly adventure if you 've never traveled before and you do n't put where you would be traveling from .
<en=14>In the United States ?
<en=15>Lots of places .
<en=16>There are 50 of them , 48 located from Maine to Florida and California to Washington State and all in between .
<en=17>There are 2 more located outside of the main continent with Alaska way to the north and Hawaii in the Pacific .
<en=18>What do you like to do ?
<en=19>Big Cities like New York , Boston , Philadelphia on the East Coast .
<en=20>Beaches and Disney of Florida or the Mid Atlantic cities of Atlanta , Savannah , Charleston .
<en=21>The federal sites of Washington , DC .
<en=22>Southern charm of Nashville , Birmingham , New Orleans or Charlotte .
<en=23>West Coast hot spots like Seattle , Portland , San Francisco , Los Angeles or San Diego .
<en=24>Europe ?
<en=25>Just as numerous as the possibilities of the US .
<en=26>Do you speak a foreign language ?
<en=27>I could spend a year in Spain alone .
<en=28>From Madrid to Seville to Barcelona an Valencia .
<en=29>Bilboa on the north coast , Pamplona and the very famous Guernica .
<en=30>A road trip to Lisbon and the Algarve in Portugal before a mountain escape in the Pyrenees and a stop in Andorra before heading over to France and Italy and Austria and Switzerland .
<en=31>I 've traveled to all of these places and could certainly tailor a trip to your needs based on budget , actual time allowed , your likes and dislikes .
<en=32>Amount of time could be dependent on so many things .
<en=33>Do you want to see all the sites or simply a few photos and on your way to the next place .
<en=34>Does your budget limit you to how long you can stay in each place ?
<en=35>You need a lot of money for hotels , airfare , seeing the sites , food , local transport - you name it but life costs .
<en=36>Once you have a budget or an amount in the bank then you 'll be able to figure out where you can go , for how long you can go and what you can do when you 're there .
<en=37>1 year before collage or college ?
<en=38>Good luck .
<en=39>I recommend buying a single unlimited Europass and travelling anywhere in the EU your heart desires .
<en=40>You ca n't beat the price for what you get .
<en=41>come to Africa .
<en=42>Nigeria , a lovely country .
<en=43>But where in nigeria ?
<en=44>Obudu cattle ranch .
<en=45>More than a tourist centre .
