<en=2>okay .... I have a dog and my mother is really really terrified of hamsters .
<en=3>Well last night while I was sleeping , my hamster escaped from his cage .
<en=4>He is in my room , but there are so many things inside there , I du n no what to do .
<en=5>I have lots of containers in there .
<en=6>Anybody give me ideas like a trap or something ?
<en=7>Find him before he finds the dog food .
<en=8>I 'm not kidding , I once lost a hamster in my house 3 months later I walk down in the basement and it was as big as a rat .
<en=9>It had been eating dog food the whole time .
<en=10>It was huge and scared the crap out of me .
<en=11>Make sure he is n't trapped somewhere & put a bowl of food out .
<en=12>He will come and eat
<en=13>Start cleaning and start looking .
