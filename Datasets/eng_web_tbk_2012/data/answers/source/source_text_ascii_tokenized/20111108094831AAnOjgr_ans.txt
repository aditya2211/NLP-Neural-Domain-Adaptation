<en=1>What s your favorite part about trail riding ?
<en=2>My favorite part is going up hill and cantering :)
<en=3>I love how it really depends on how good a horse your horse really is , not how talented he is .
<en=4>If you took some Olympic - level horses on a trail ride , they just could n't do it .
<en=5>They would be too scared and spooky .
<en=6>It does n't matter how graceful your horse is , or how high he can jump , or how well he does a sliding stop .
<en=7>What matters is how well trained he is , and how good your bond it .
<en=8>That is another reason why I like competitive trail riding also .
<en=9>Nobody pays someone to keep their horse in shape and rides once a week , then takes all the ribbons at the show because their horse is good .
<en=10>YOU have to spend the time training .
<en=11>And I have not met one stuck - up trail rider !
<en=12>Those are just a few reasons why I love trail riding , competitive or not .
<en=13>Same , when I 'm galloping in an open space like that I can just forget everything .
<en=14>Seeing the nature and wild life that if you keep quiet you can get up close and personal .
<en=15>I have had several close encounters with both foxes and wild deer .
<en=16>Also woodpeckers were pecking in the trees and I just sat and watched .
<en=17>Fascinating .
