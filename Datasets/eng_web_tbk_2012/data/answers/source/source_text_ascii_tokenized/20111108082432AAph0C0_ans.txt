<en=1>I need creative art ideas ?
<en=2>What are some cool ideas for making a postor usint the word MAD on a white paper in a weird or artsy way ?
<en=3>The actual word " MAD " has to be on the cover and incorporated into the image .
<en=4>MAD means crazy , or angry , so you do a lot with it , i would put a gorrilla screaming , just the face , and just throw in a lot of brushes fifferent colors , make it look artistic .
<en=5>use photoshop .
<en=6>tttthhhhh Madonna !
