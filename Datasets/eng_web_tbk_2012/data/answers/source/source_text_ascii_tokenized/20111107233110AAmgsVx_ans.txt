<en=1>Is Fujairah a nice place to live in ?
<en=2>My family and I are planning to shift to Fujairah in a couple of years .
<en=3>So I just needed to know if it is a suitable place to live in and in what ways .
<en=4>Also that , I heard in the next few years Fujairah would be as good as Dubai , is it true ?
<en=5>I 'd be happy if someone helps , especially someone who has been to Fujairah or lives there . :)
<en=6>I LIVE THERE !
<en=7>... I ve been living in Fujairah my entire life and I must say that it is developing in a good way .
<en=8>I think 2012 is going to be a great year for Fujairah as we have A LOT of projects to be done by 2012 .
<en=9>Things to do in Fujairah ..
<en=10>It s between sea and mountains so you can camp on beach or between mountains !
<en=11>... Fishing , Jet skies , snorkeling , diving are some of the things you can do for fun .
<en=12>And now they are finishing a road between Fujairah and Dubai in 45 minutes only !
<en=13>So , no it is not as good as Dubai , but it s quieter and more peaceful , and you can still go to Dubai in 45 mins .
<en=14>please let me know if you need anything else
<en=15>Visited Fujairah when in Dubai .
<en=16>Nothing like Dubai , and never will be !
<en=17>Do n't know the economics of Fujairah but Dubai is basically bankrupt so you would n't want to end up like them !
<en=18>Unless you have a particular skill they need - and firm job offer before going - I would think twice about it !
