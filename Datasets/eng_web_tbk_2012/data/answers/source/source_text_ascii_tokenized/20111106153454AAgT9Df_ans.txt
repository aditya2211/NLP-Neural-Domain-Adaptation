<en=1>In Chicago , what is the best restaurant to dine at on a budget ?
<en=2>Downtown Chicago , Loop , North
<en=3>Take the red line to Clark , then you turn right .
<en=4>Walk 2 blocks then turn right again .
<en=5>Walk 2 more blocks then cross the street .
<en=6>You will get to a place called " BIG BOWL " .
<en=7>THAI FOOD AND ASIAN .
<en=8>BEST PLACE EVER !!!!!!!!!!!!
<en=9>McDonald s
<en=10>Not necessarily the restaurant but what you order when you get there and what time you go .
<en=11>A lunch will be less expensive than a dinner .
<en=12>You can order appetizers rather than a full meal and have just as good a dinner .
<en=13>But the best way is to use coupons .
<en=14>Check out http://www.restaurant.com lots of restaurants you can look at the menu and check out prices .
<en=15>Yo also may want to try " small neighborhood " restaurants and support family run places rather than the large corporate chains .
<en=16>Not that there is anything wrong with that because they also employ local people that live and shop in the area .
