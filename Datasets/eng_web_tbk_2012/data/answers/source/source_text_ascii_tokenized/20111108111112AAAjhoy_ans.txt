<en=3>I 've tried bland white rice but he wo nt eat anything .
<en=4>What could it be ?
<en=5>Should I be concerned ?
<en=6>Call a vet would be a good idea with a sick dog
<en=7>VERY CONCERNED !!!
<en=8>plz bring your dog to the vet ASAP !!!
<en=9>esp if not eating - if it had only happened once and could get him to eat right away - it could have been you missed his meal time and he needed to eat - since it sounds like it has happened several times over two days - then he may have gotten int to something that needs to be attended to RIGHT AWAY !!!
<en=10>or has acquired some type of disease and that too needs to be attended to ...
