<en=1>What 's the best time to start a trip around the world ?
<en=2>Well , I 'm about to graduate in less then a year , and I 'm planning to study medical school .
<en=3>But since in my country it lasts for minimum 6 years , and I want to go aground the world , what do you think , should I do it before or after medical school ?
<en=4>If you can afford to go before , then by all means , GO .
<en=5>If you have to wait , due to financial reasons , then wait .
<en=6>I would much rather put it off until I can afford to have the vacation of a lifetime as I 'm sure this trip is intended to be .
<en=7>Airfare alone will be incredibly expensive so make sure you have the money and of course free time to take your time and have a great time .
