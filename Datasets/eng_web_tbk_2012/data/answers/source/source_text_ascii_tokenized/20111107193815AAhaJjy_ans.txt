<en=1>Question about the sinking of the Titanic ?
<en=2>After the sinking of the Titanic in 1912 , was there a law made so that ships would carry enough lifeboats to save everybody on a ship if it was sinking ?
<en=3>If yes , was Canada involved in this act / law ?
<en=4>Sorry , I 'm just very nervous after watching the movie .
<en=5>SOLAS ( Safety Of Life At Sea ) , which is an international maritime treaty , came about in response to the tragedy of the Titanic .
<en=6>Today , it is the primary safety law affecting virtually all ships , regardless of country of registration .
<en=7>If you ever go on a cruise ship , you will be required to attend a SOLAS muster drill ( lifeboat drill ) within 24 hours of sailing .
<en=8>Most ships perform this drill before even leaving the dock .
<en=9>SOLAS covers just about every aspect of safety at sea , including minimum safety equipment , practices , and standards , lifeboats , navigation practices , fire protection , and so on .
<en=10>We are much safer today on board ship due to SOLAS , and I suppose if any good came out of the Titanic tragedy , the adoption of SOLAS is probably it .

<en=13>Edit : Also I forgot to mention earlier , most ( if not all ) cruise ships also practice lifeboat drills weekly , and it is not uncommon to see them to actually launch the lifeboats into the water as part of their drill when you are in port .
<en=14>This not only ensures the lifeboats are operational and will work if needed , but makes the crew proficient at launching them .
<en=15>I do n't think so
<en=16>Do n't worry .
<en=17>When was the last time you heard about a ship sinking ?
<en=18>100 years ago ?
