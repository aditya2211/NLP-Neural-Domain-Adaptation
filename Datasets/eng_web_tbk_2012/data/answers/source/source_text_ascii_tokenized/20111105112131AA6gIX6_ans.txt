<en=1>My dad just does n't understand ?
<en=2>Ugh my dad is so stupid ... he just does n't understand anything !
<en=3>I have 5 sisters and so including my mom ... he is the only guy in a house of six females .
<en=4>Now I 'm the youngest and I just got my period so now we all have ours and he thinks it 's a good thing ?
<en=5>He 's always like " ohh you must be so happy to finally have yours , I wish I had mine ! " and he is n't even joking .
<en=6>I think just living in a house with so many girls is making him go crazy ?
<en=7>Yep , the females are just getting to him ... dads ..
<en=8>Do n't blame him please , he feels lonely and wants to show his attention to all of you to look after you , please forgive and sympathy if he miss something .
<en=9>I am sorry for him , he is a good dad
