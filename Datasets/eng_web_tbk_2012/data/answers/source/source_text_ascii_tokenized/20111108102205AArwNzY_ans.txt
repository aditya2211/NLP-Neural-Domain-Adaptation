<en=1>Cheapest airline ticket from Raleigh to Philippines ?
<en=2>I 'm going on a vacation to the Philippines in May 2012 , and I 'm starting from Raleigh , NC ( RDU Airport ) .
<en=3>Which airlines should I look into and when should I buy my ticket ?
<en=4>The sooner the better but I 'd probably wait until after the holidays .
<en=5>Use Travelocity or Expedia and see what you come up with .
<en=6>My friend goes to the Phils every 6 months or so and she has found that Korean Air has had the cheapest fares lately .
<en=7>Raleigh to Chicago , Chicago to Seoul and then Seoul to Manila .
<en=8>Compare compare compare - that 's the key to getting the best deal .
<en=9>Ask a travel agent !
<en=10>On my last 6 trips here from the states I used " Fly genesis " based in Seattle , Wa .
<en=11>They gave the best service & rates I could find .
