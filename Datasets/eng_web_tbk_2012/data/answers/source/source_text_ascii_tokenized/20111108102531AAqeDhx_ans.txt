<en=1>I have a male and female cockatiel , and there are 2 eggs in the bottom of the cage , will they hatch ?
<en=2>Most likely not , if there is not a bird sitting on the eggs .
<en=3>This is hard to tell .
<en=4>Cockatiels can lay unfertilized eggs as well .
<en=5>Just because you have a male and female , it can not be guaranteed the two mated .
<en=6>You can try picking up the eggs and holding it up against a very bright light .
<en=7>If you see a dark spot in the egg , that means it is fertilized and will hatch if cared for properly .
<en=8>Have fun .
