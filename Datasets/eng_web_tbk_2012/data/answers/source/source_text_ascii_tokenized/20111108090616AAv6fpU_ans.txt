<en=4>What do you think of these photos ?
<en=5>The lighting was not the best , but the pics turned out ok in my opinion .
<en=6>deleting a question where you do nt like the answer wo n't get you better answers ... i refer to my previous answer :
<en=7>you need to learn about white balance , composition , angle , and work on using the camera properly ...
<en=8>[ edit - and she most be very new to modeling , because she does look unsure of her poses )
<en=9>lol , he has posted this so many times today already .
<en=10>clearly he s mad that people know he took her pic off the net and it 's NOT his gf
<en=11>Not bad , but too many distracting elements for my taste .
<en=12>For example :
<en=13>In the photo on the couch , the pillow she is resting on clashes with everything else in the shot .
<en=14>There are also some distracting background elements like the light fixture and what looks like a door handle on the left .
<en=15>In the standing photo ( from the front ) there is a corner of a rug creeping in , some kind of box in the lower right corner and what looks like a power cord .
<en=16>In the shot from the back , the crumpled bottom of the curtain is pretty noticeable as well as the power outlet .
<en=17>Compositionally , this one is not my favorite , I would suggest trying a different crop because I do nt think cutting her off at the calf looks great .
<en=18>I do like the shadow , though .
<en=19>My suggestion is to pay close attention to what 's going on in the background and if possible , stand on a chair , get on the ground , do whatever you need to do to get rid of distracting elements .
<en=20>Using a fairly wide aperture is also helpful in blurring out unwanted background elements .
<en=21>I 've had a few great shots ruined myself because there was something in the background I did n't notice at first .
