<en=1>what are some unique customs in ireland ?
<en=2>As far ask I 'm aware our most unique custom would be the " Country Wake " .
<en=3>In all my travels I 've never seen anything like it and am often met with an odd look when I explain them to foreigners .
<en=4>After a person dies , their remains are " waked " in their home for roughly 2 - 3 days .
<en=5>In this time visitors will come to the house , pay their respects to the desisted and their family and have a couple of cups of tea with a sandwich or a bun .
<en=6>The wake also included the night sit were friends and family sit up through the night with the remains .
<en=7>Wakes are common both north and south of the boarder with Protestants and Catholics alike .
<en=8>But only really in the countryside .
<en=9>The only notable difference I have noticed is that in the south of Ireland one night of the wake is often held in the chapel the night before the funeral , this tradition started after the civil war .
<en=10>Another unique custom ( and a dying one at that ) is the Pioneers .
<en=11>The Pioneers was an organization started at the end of the 19th century which pushed and supported the ideal of temperance ( abstaining from alcohol ) , in an attempt to deal with the massive issue of alcoholism that Ireland was gripped by .
<en=12>Pioneers take a pledge to remain tee - total and at the hight of the organization popularity , had an estimated two million members even filling Croke Park on the 25th anniversary .
<en=13>I my self am one but appreciate that the organization is unlikely to make into the 22nd century .
<en=14>The Orange Order and the 12th of July Marches would be argued by some not to be an Irish custom but unarguable ticks every criteria to be considered one .
<en=15>The marches on the 12th of July are only really attended by protestants in the Ulster but in spite of the are the largest attended paraded in Ireland .
<en=16>Barn brack and the ring .
<en=17>the irish customs we have in our family are ; we make sinnel cake for easter , barn brack and col - cannon for Halloween .
<en=18>christmas cake for christmas day .
