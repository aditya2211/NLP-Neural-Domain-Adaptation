<en=1>How much should I be looking at for horse transportation ?
<en=2>I need one horse transported to shows throughout the 2012 show season , and the location is about 3 hours away from where I live .
<en=3>The place where I 'm boarding is not likely to want to take me this far , and I do not have any ways of hauling him myself .
<en=4>So I want to hire someone ( or multiple people ) to transport me to these shows .
<en=5>If they ask how much I 'm willing to pay , what is a good price range ?
<en=6>I saw a site that charges $ 0.70 per mile .
<en=7>Is that reasonable ?
<en=8>Impossible to say , but I guess you would have to work out fuel consumption for the particular vehicle that they are using and pay a proportion of that , and some on top for the driver 's time and effort , unless you are able to share transport with another or more , that would keep the costs down .
<en=9>Remember that you get what you pay for .
<en=10>Three hours is n't far , but you are doing multiple shows .
<en=11>Some people are willing to take your horse , but they really have old trailers that are not the safest in the world .
<en=12>Rusted , torn corners in the stalls , unhealthy air , straight load instead of slant load can all make travelling hard , if not downright dangerous , on your horse .
<en=13>I had my horse transported from CA to WA and he came on this big , open stock trailer .
<en=14>He was dehydrated when he got there and lost weight .
<en=15>Since then , I now use a professional horse hauling service with people who ride with my horse to keep an eye on him , stop every few hours for water , and their trailers all have super smooth suspension .
<en=16>All horses I 've had delivered to me since then are happy and healthy when they arrive .
<en=17>I would call Bob Hubbard Transport and get a quote .
<en=18>Even though you may not want to use them , it will give you some idea of what it might cost and what is fair .
<en=19>See link below .
<en=20>Make sure the trailer service you use is bonded / insured and knows something about first aid .
