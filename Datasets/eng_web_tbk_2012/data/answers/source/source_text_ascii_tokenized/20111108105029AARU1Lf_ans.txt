<en=1>Please help with my cat s bladder issue ?
<en=2>I have a 1 1 / 2 year old female calico .
<en=3>When she was spayed the vet had a hard time because she only has one uterine horn and he said this could mean she only has on kidney .
<en=4>Recently she has been peeing A LOT .
<en=5>I 'm talking soaking all the litter box and then some .
<en=6>She is also peeing around the box and somehow it gets underneath .
<en=7>I do n't have the money to take her to a vet right now but it 's getting to be an issue .
<en=8>I have to scrub the floor 2 - 3 times a week now .
<en=9>What could be the issue and can I try some home remedies first ?
<en=10>I love her and want to help her but I do n't know when I 'll be able to take her to to vet :( please help .
<en=11>First of all , I am very sorry to hear you 're having this issue with your cat . :(
<en=12>Frequent urination is a sign of several things .
<en=13>Bladder or Urinary tract infections are two common ones , but these usually are frequent visits , with small amounts of urine being passed .
<en=14>If there is blood in the urine , or the cat seems to be in pain , then that is also a good indicator .
<en=15>But your cat is passing a LOT of urine , and this is bad .
<en=16>Given the chance your cat may only have one kidney , I would think the worst case scenario would be kidney disease , which untreated can lead to possible renal failure .
<en=17>Signs of this can be hard to spot , and if this is true in her case she will definitely need to see a vet .
<en=18>Vomiting , bad breath , and listlessness .
<en=19>Seizures will occur when the toxins that the kidney normally filters out are released into the blood stream .
<en=20>I know you are very worried , but getting her to the vet is the best thing you can do for her .
<en=21>In the meantime make sure she had plenty of water available to her .
