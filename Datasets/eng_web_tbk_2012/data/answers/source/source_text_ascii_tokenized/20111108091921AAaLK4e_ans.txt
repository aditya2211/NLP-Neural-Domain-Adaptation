<en=1>This is about my farrier , girls .
<en=2>That 's why I 'm posting here !
<en=3>Help ?
<en=4>I posted this in singles and dating too , so I 've just copied and pasted .
<en=5>Well , I 'll try to make this short .
<en=6>I have known this guy for a long time , but we 've never been good friends or anything .
<en=7>He is my farrier ( shoes my horse s feet ) so I am technically a client if you want to view it that way .
<en=8>Well , almost two weeks ago he came out and did my horse s feet and was SO flirty .
<en=9>He always hugs me when he comes , but he gave me at least 5 tight , long , back rubbing hugs while he was there .
<en=10>We were also just talking about my horse 's crappy feet and he mentioned .
<en=11>" Well , if you ever just want to see me I 'll come out and look him over and then we can grab a coffee after . "
<en=12>That has NEVER happened before so I was kinda realizing at that point that he was a little interested .
<en=13>Right ??
<en=14>Anyway , so he ended up leaving one nail out of my horse s foot ( I 've never heard of a farrier doing this ) and telling me to call him in a few days ( first it was a week , then it was a few days lol ) and he 'd come back out and put it in .
<en=15>He told me to remember to call like 3 times before he left .
<en=16>So , I waited a week to call because I was busy and I wanted to have him come out on a day when I am more available in case we were to hang out after ;)
<en=17>Anyway , so that was 2 days ago that I called and left a message , but he still has n't called back yet .
<en=18>I do n't know if I should call him again tomorrow or not ?
<en=19>I know a lot of people say to wait until he calls you , but it 's different because I 'm a client and technically that 's all I am at this point .
<en=20>On the other hand though , if I 'm a client he should really of called back by now because you do n't leave a customer hanging .
<en=21>He did n't have my number either because this was the first time I 've called HIM instead of his dad .
<en=22>It 's a father and son business .
<en=23>Anyway , I would appreciate ANY insight on this at all .
<en=24>Thank you for reading if you did ! :)
<en=25>Ok , well as far as him being a bad farrier for leaving a nail out - That is not the case , they are extremely well known farriers in the area .
<en=26>I would be a lot more concerned if the shoe fell off because it was missing one lousy nail .
<en=27>The reason he said he did n't put that nail in was because he " did n't want to risk it " with my horse 's horrible feet .
<en=28>This is about the fourth time they 've done my horse 's feet because I just switched back to them .
<en=29>The only reason I switched away from them in the first place is because my good friend who apprenticed with them was starting out on his own .
<en=30>However , he left my horse without a shoe for TWO WEEKS ( now that 's what I call a crap farrier ) .
<en=31>Which , I might add is the same foot that keeps crumbling with the nails .
<en=32>So , obviously I switched back to these guys .
<en=33>Ok , calm down , it 's not like he 's some stranger that came up and groped me lol .
<en=34>I 've known the guy for about 10 years .
<en=35>I am 21 , so yeah we were both kids when we knew each other !
<en=36>He is a few years older than me .
<en=37>And yes , I do like him .
<en=38>To answer Barry White , yes that did occur to me :) I hope that is all he 's waiting for .
<en=39>On the other hand , he could very easily just call me and say hey I 'm busy right now , I 'll call you when I can come out .
<en=40>And as far as scheduled visits go , I have no idea .
<en=41>I 've never done that before though either .
<en=42>It 's always just " Okay , they're feet need to be done , better call the farrier . "
<en=43>And they usually come out within a few days .
<en=44>He will call you back I m sure !
<en=45>Sounds like He really likes you ..
<en=46>But you need to ask yourself do you feel the same way ?
<en=47>would You like going for * coffee * with him ?
<en=48>or is he Not your type ?
<en=49>Or are you undecided ?
<en=50>If i were you I would Go ...
<en=51>I would say if he does not call you back by friday call him again he could be playing hard to get ?
<en=52>I think he left the Nail out of the shoe as a excuse to come back and see you hey he may be your Prince charming ..
<en=53>Edit ... I really do nt think Your horse Is in danger Of being hurt With one Nail missing ..
<en=54>I have seen horses Loose Nails On there Own And do just fine with ONE nail gone Now if he had left out 2 or 3 I would be wondering to ...
<en=55>I really do belive he left the nail out becuse of the horse s Hoof condition and It s a added bonus he would get to see her again
<en=56>When I was Younger In my early 20s My farrier was A hottie named Joby .. ( for those who do n't Know I AM A GIRL read my Bio on my Page ) dumb as a post about everything But horses ..
<en=57>He was In his 30s divorced and Had 2 kids .. but we both flirted Horribly with each other .. but neither one of us took the chance and Asked to other on a date . :(
<en=58>sort a wonder what it would have been like ?
<en=59>But That was Years ago .
<en=60>He had this Habit of telling you Everything ..
<en=61>Well one day he said to me You know i do n't wear Underwear as he was bent over Working on my Mare s Right front hoof .. and I was Like Ummmm okay ???
<en=62>I m glad his butt was facing me so he could n't see my red face I think my Mare was even laughing ..
<en=63>Well 6 weeks Later when he came back out He was again working on my mare s front Foot and I looked Down and Yeah he had Wholes In his pants In the wrong places I bust out Laughing and He was like what ???
<en=64>I was like Ummmm i can see your ass cheeks ... he was like Oops did i forget my Underwear ???
<en=65>that was a strange way to flirt .. but i guss it was his way ...
<en=66>But like i said nothing ever came of It .. the next time I saw him He had told Me he had To get married to a girl Who he worked with becuse he knocked Her Up ..
<en=67>I was heartbroken .. but then realized He was not the Guy for me ..
<en=68>Wow he does sound interested in you , my farrier never gives me hugs like that ( probably a good thing as he has a wife and 2 kids ) anyway , I find that they can be very busy so I would wait a week lo9nger and if still no reply give him a call but do n't leave a message so you do n't have to necessarily wait for him to call .
<en=69>From the point of view of a business , and client / operator relationships , he 's doing a really shitty job .
<en=70>Leaving nails out so you 'll call and have him come back out later ?
<en=71>Cute or not , I 'd call a different bloke because he 's doing a sub-par job at something he needs to be doing his best at , whether he 's flirting or trying to ask you out or not , he ought to put quality first .
<en=72>This is , after all , his business , and if he wants you to remain a customer why on earth is he doing shoddy work ?
