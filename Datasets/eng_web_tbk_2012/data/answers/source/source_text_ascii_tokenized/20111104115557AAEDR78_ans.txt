<en=1>Does Crack Barrel ban employees from having tattoos ?
<en=2>I 'm suppose to start a job at Cracker Barrel , but I ca n't risk losing the job because I have two visible tattoos on my arm .
<en=3>If you know or work there could you enlighten me ?
<en=4>Why do n't you phone another location and ask <
<en=5>I do n't think they ban if the tats are n't offensive and you should make them not noticeable at the time of the interview but once you got the job there nothing they can really say if so you have a sue / case against them
