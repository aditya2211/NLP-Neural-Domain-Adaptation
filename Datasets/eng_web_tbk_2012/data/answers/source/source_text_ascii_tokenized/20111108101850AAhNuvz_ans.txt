<en=1>Can rabbits and chickens live together ?
<en=2>I am thinking about getting a rabbit as a pet , but my parents said that it has to stay outside .
<en=3>We also own two chickens that are kept in a run behind out garage / barn thing .
<en=4>There is already a little dog house that I would turn into a little rabbit hutch being kept back there and I was thinking about keeping the rabbit in the run with the chickens , but keeping the chickens in the coop and the rabbit in the hutch at night .
<en=5>However , in the day time would it be okay for the rabbit to hop around along with the chickens ?
<en=6>We feed the chickens scraps of veggies and fruits throughout the day , but it 's nothing that a rabbit would n't be able to digest just fine .
<en=7>So , can rabbits and chickens live together as long as they have separate places for their food and water ?
<en=8>( The rabbit hutch would have an opening only big enough for the rabbit , the chickens would not be able to get to the rabbit food ) Also , is it okay if the rabbit occasionally sneaks a few bites of chicken feed ?
<en=9>My last rabbit did that a few times , and he was fine ...
<en=10>I just wan na make sure :) Thank !
<en=11>Yes , but be sure that your chickens are all hens ( I mean not roosters ) , Roosters may attack rabbits or anything they see moving , so be aware of that , hens are friendly with almost all kinds of pets !
<en=12>From my experience Hens ( Not roosters ) are very friendly with duck , Guinea pigs , kittens , cows , Rabbits , etc .
<en=13>Be sure not to feed your rabbits non-veg items !
<en=14>You said they live in different cages and they are free in day , so no problem , do n't put both of them in one cage because rabbits bedding is different than that of hens , wet bedding can cause diseases in them !
<en=15>So , do n't put both of them in one cage .
<en=16>Good luck !
<en=17>yea i guess but rabbits a easily escape a pen or another rabbit could get in there and that rabbit could be the opposite gender .
<en=18>So be very careful and some feeds could be toxic to rabbits and safe for chickens .
<en=19>Rabbits do burrow also so do n't be surprised if chicken are falling into holes .
<en=20>rabbits are delicate and can get diseases so watch out for that .
