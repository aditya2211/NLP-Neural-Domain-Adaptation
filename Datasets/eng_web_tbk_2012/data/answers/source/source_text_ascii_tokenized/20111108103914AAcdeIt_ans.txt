<en=1>How can i get my kitten to stop biting when he plays ?
<en=2>I have a kitten who just turned 3 months today .
<en=3>He 's a good kitty , just when he plays he bites REALLY hard .
<en=4>Almost every day he 'd even wake me up like 5 am in the morning , trying to bite my arm .
<en=5>And when I move it I guess he figures I 'm playing . x.x
<en=6>I read somewhere that you have to hold his mouth together , and keep it that way til he panics .
<en=7>That seems cruel to me though .
<en=8>Any other way ??
<en=9>Do you think he 's teething ?
<en=10>It 's getting out of hand .
<en=11>Yeah , I thought that the holding his mouth thing sounded wrong .
<en=12>No worries , i did n't try .
<en=13>He does have toys , a scratching post , LOTS of mice , balls , yarn , a feathery birdy toy , etc .
<en=14>He 'd just randomly walk up to you and start the biting .
<en=15>When i put him off of my bed , he jumps back on and same thing .
<en=16>he may be teething but i do nt think it can be stopped .
<en=17>maybe buy him toys that he can play with that give him a way to use his energy up
<en=18>yes do not hold any animal s mouth shut it wil close their air way , he s just a kitty and they are very rambunctious , get him toys .
<en=19>lots of them , feather ones work best , also when he bites you in the morning put him down off your bed , to show him that you will not tolerate that , he will get it , he s also probably teething , so toys are your best bet
