<en=1>Crayola Air - Dry Clay ?
<en=2>Ok .
<en=3>So I have a VERY long list of people I want to make Xmas gifts for and one of them is my best friend .
<en=4>She loves giraffes and homemade things !
<en=5>I am very artistic so I decided I was going to make her a giraffe sculpture .
<en=6>I do n't have much money so I bought Crayola Air - Dry Clay .
<en=7>I have sculpted the giraffe laying down .
<en=8>The key is ... I have a few problems :
<en=9>1 . I tested it out by making a figure boat
<en=10>And after 4 days when it dried it was very fragile !
<en=11>( like VERY not in a good way )
<en=12>Is there any way to strengthen it ?
<en=13>2 . What kind of paint do I use to paint the giraffe ?
<en=14>3 . Is there any cheap way to give it a shine like I made it in a kiln ?
<en=15>air dry clay works on armatures , the clay has a minor shrink percent , so you can leave the wire armature inside , paint with acrylic paint
