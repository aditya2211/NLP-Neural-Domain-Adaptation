<en=1>dead pixel of my photos ?
<en=2>just want to ask .. i have an nikon dslr .. i m wondering why if i zoom my picture zoom like almost 200 - 300 percent .. i can see some dead pixel ... is there something wrong with my camera body ?
<en=3>lens ?
<en=4>or what ?
<en=5>please help me .. and what should i do to fix this problem ?
<en=6>or it is normal ?
<en=7>Are you sure it is n't dirt on the sensor ?
<en=8>Put the camera on manual focus and set focus to infinity
<en=9>Take a photo of a very light plain subject close to the lens using long exposure and smallest aperture you have - over expose by a couple of stops
<en=10>You will see in the image if there is dirt as that will be the only thing in focus
<en=11>Cure is to get the sensor cleaned
<en=12>There should be a Pixel Mapping function in the menu that will get rid of them , most sensors have a few dead and flipped pixels , some only show up on long exposures .
