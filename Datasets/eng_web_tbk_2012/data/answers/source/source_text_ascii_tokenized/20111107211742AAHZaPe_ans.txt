<en=1>True or false : being a young New Zealander means having no future ?
<en=2>There are no jobs in this country .
<en=3>I 'm just trying to make up my mind whether I should move to Australia or seek work in the sex industry .
<en=4>Is there a future for our nation 's youth ?
<en=5>@ Ryan B ,
<en=6>I 'm two years into an undergraduate degree .
<en=7>Everybody I know at university intends to stay at uni for as long as possible until there are actually jobs available .
<en=8>Everybody seems to flee this country and move overseas , to Australia , etc .
<en=9>There 's obviously a reason for that ( lack of employment , low incomes , etc . )
<en=10>Your answer does n't do anything but remind me that I 'm going to be $ 25,000 in debt by the time I 'm 22 .
<en=11>So , thanks .
<en=12>@ W.a.b.b.y ,
<en=13>I really like you're answer .
<en=14>it 's very logical .
<en=15>I 've also considered becoming a teacher , but it 's not a job I 'm cut out for .
<en=16>I also wish I 'd applied for a scholarship .
<en=17>I did n't think I 'd be awarded one , but I received the Dux Litterarum award at high school , so my chances were probably better than I thought they were .
<en=18>Obviously I 'm still completely stupid though .
<en=19>I mean , I was n't smart enough to apply for a scholarship .
<en=20>And yes , I am being melodramatic .
<en=21>Lol .
<en=22>@ Hatmanone ,
<en=23>* gasps * So I would n't make a good prostitute ?
<en=24>Are you saying I 'm bad in bed ?
<en=25>How would you know ?
<en=26>Joking .
<en=27>Your answer is very sweet , but I 'm not compassionate towards teenage high school students .
<en=28>A little mellow dramatic ?
<en=29>In my opinion , far too many people are at university studying worthless degrees .
<en=30>Yes things like philosophy and fashion design are interesting , but how many jobs are out there for someone with these qualifications ?
<en=31>I 'm studying to be a teacher , so I know that there will definitely be jobs out there when I 'm done .
<en=32>I may have to live somewhere rural or in Auckland , but at least I can be pretty sure I 'll be employable .
<en=33>I 've also got a bachelor s degree so I can go back and do further study or take a different profession .
<en=34>I also know that you do n't get paid that much more in Australia than you do here .
<en=35>And it 's not all about how much you earn , cost of living is much higher in many cities in Australia .
<en=36>Try living in Sydney on a teacher 's salary , then compare it to somewhere like Central Otago .
<en=37>You also have to put up with all the annoying accents in Australia .
<en=38>It 's probably not a wise idea to keep studying and having a massive student loan .
<en=39>At the moment there 's no interest , but that 'll probably change .
<en=40>And they 'll probably add interest to what you 've already racked up .
<en=41>And they 're working towards being able to extradite people who have left the country to avoid paying it back .
<en=42>At the moment if you move overseas you can only come back to New Zealand for a short amount of time before they 'll force you cough up .
<en=43>And all that time you 're overseas you 'll be racking up interest .
<en=44>I would n't like not having the option to return to NZ .
<en=45>I guess I 'm extremely fortunate that I received a scholarship which paid about 800 f my course fees through my degree .
<en=46>But I worked hard and I 'm still working hard .
<en=47>There are far too many lazy people out there who think that they can sit around a job will fall in their lap .
<en=48>My 2 c. ....
<en=49>Get an education !
<en=50>I 'm doing fine .
<en=51>Whilst youth jobs are thin on the ground , do n't assume it 's better in Oz .
<en=52>People have been fleeing this country at roughly a plane load per week for the past 20 + years , so it 's not anything new .
<en=53>It depends on what you hunger for .
<en=54>700 f jobs are n't advertised .
<en=55>That means making yourself known ; that means networking .
