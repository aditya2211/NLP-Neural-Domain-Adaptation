<en=1>why are there two statues of David ?
<en=2>i doing a research paper on donatello and i notice that there are two statues of David , a bronze one and marble one .
<en=3>Michelangelo made the marble one but why did he do another if Donatello had already made one ?
<en=4>so i m a little confused , why is there two statues of David ?
<en=5>different generations , the donatello is of a boy david as a young sheep Herder , the Michelangelo is the grown up man david as slayer and king
<en=6>Because he liked making statues of David ! :D
<en=7>Obviously , he should have been arrested and jailed - imagine making a statue or painting on the same subject as another artist - clearly insulting and disrespecting - wasted time that could have been used making a statue with clothes on .
