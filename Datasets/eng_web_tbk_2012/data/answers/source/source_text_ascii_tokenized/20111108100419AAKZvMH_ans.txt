<en=1>My Snake 's meal is TOO big , what can I do ?
<en=2>Just today I bought a medium rat for my beloved Ball Python Salazar ( name after Harry Potter ) .
<en=3>Last time I got a medium rat it was a girl and my snake handled her easily .
<en=4>But today , I got a boy and realized that he is HUGE !
<en=5>I really do love my snake cause she is actually an affectionate cold - blooded creature .
<en=6>So my true question comes to this , how can I knock the rat out ?
<en=7>If I threw him against a wall and still conscious he will run away , do I hang him by the tail so the blood can flush into his skull ?
<en=8>I really do need answers and advice , and NOT INSULTING ANSWERS !!
<en=9>LIKE SERIOUSLY !! >:(
<en=10>Best answer shall receive points :)
<en=11>iw ould just stick him in the tank and let your snake have a nice hunt for once , snakes jaws detach for this sort of this thing , so why not give her a good hunt , but if you do want him knock him i d just throw him against the wall or something ,, lol i do nt know , i agree with you though throw him , haha
<en=12>Ok so if youre snake will take pre-killed , you can " gas it " .
<en=13>Just put the rat in a sealed tupperwear container with no airholes and wait until it passes out and dies and then feed it .
<en=14>If it wo n't take pre-killed and you usually feed live then you could hold the rat by the tail and whack it against a hard surface , like a refrigerator or wall .
<en=15>I do n't like that option though - I think it 's pretty cruel and I'd not done properly you 'll end up really hurting the rat but not stunning him enough to stop possible injury to your snake .
<en=16>I would do the tupperwear idea TBH - easiest and most humane .
<en=17>You could also just wait until the rat passes out for about 1 minute and them feed it - at this point , it could still have a bit of a heart beat and be slightly still alive .
<en=18>And also maybe try holding the rat in feeding prongs so your snake can get a good hold and grip on his prey .
<en=19>Good luck !
<en=20>Just my opinion here - no judgement - getting your snake on frozen / thawed will prove to be much easier for you and safer for your snake in the long run .
<en=21>My opinion - take it for what it 's worth . :-)
