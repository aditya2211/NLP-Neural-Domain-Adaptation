<en=1>Looking to move to Toronto ?
<en=2>I am a 20 something gay black male and I am looking for suggestions on neighborhoods close to the downtown Toronto area .
<en=3>Im moving from South Carolina so this will already be a huge culture shock .
<en=4>Any suggestions ?
<en=5>Being gay and living in Toronto is just fine .
<en=6>You may consider the Gay Village on Church Street , right downtown .
<en=7>It is full of gay friendly " everything " .
<en=8>But , you could live where ever you fancy takes you .
<en=9>For obvious reasons , knowing how extremely difficult it is to drive a car in the city , you should probably try to be near the subway system .
<en=10>But , can you immigrate ?
<en=11>Being an American guarantees you no favours when it come to going to Canada .
<en=12>Start your process here , if you have n't already .
<en=13>( Marrying a Canadian is not enough - that does n't count for at least two years . )
<en=14>http://www.cic.gc.ca/english/immigrate/index.asp
<en=15>A normal processing time , unless you have an advanced degree or a " specified " skill is from 3 - 5 years .
<en=16>Coming to stay , and overstay your three months visit will lead to immediate expulsion and a lifetime ban to immigrate to Canada - NOT GOOD .
<en=17>Let s be clear about this ...........
<en=18>Just ' wanting to come to Canada " is NOT enough .
<en=19>You MUST apply , to become a Immigrant , and WAIT to be approved , by the Canadian Government .
<en=20>YOUR education ( the more the better ) and your past work history , combined with a CLEAN FBI and State Police record , and a satisfactory financial history ( no bankruptcies or large outstanding debts in the USA ) are all taken into consideration .
<en=21>It is a competition , and YOU will be competing with hundreds of thousands of others , from all over the world , for a place in the line up .
<en=22>IF you have NOT begun the Application process's NOW < you are about 2 to 3 years away from being approved by Immigration Canada .
<en=23>So do n't pack your bags , yet .
<en=24>Whatever you do ............... DO NOT try to come here with out legal permission .
<en=25>You will not be able to seek work or take a job , in Canada , with out having to show your Immigration VISA and Canadian Social Insurance Number card to any potential employer .
<en=26>Being an American and from the " south " you will be noticed as soon as you speak out loud .
<en=27>Do it properly , and legally , and you will be OK .
