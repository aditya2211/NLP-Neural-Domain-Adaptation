<en=1>Women 's rain coat ... where can I find one ?
<en=2>I 'm going on a trip to Europe soon , and I need to find a good , quality raincoat .
<en=3>I 've looked and looked , but can not find one anywhere !
<en=4>I would prefer a simple , fitted black one .
<en=5>It actually needs to be relatively waterproof - the last one I bought had me soaked in anything more than light / moderate rain .
<en=6>I 'll pay up to 200 - 250 for it if I have to .
<en=7>Look on the debenhams website
<en=8>in the craghoppers section
