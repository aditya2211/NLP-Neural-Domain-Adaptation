<en=1>Best way to change 35 mm film in Holga 120 whilst out and about ?
<en=2>I 've modified my Holga 120 to take 35 mm film and I know that you ca n't wind the film back , you have to open the back of the camera ( in a darkroom ) to rewind the film .
<en=3>What do other Holga owners do when they need to change film when they are traveling ?
<en=4>Do you just take a changing bag with you ?
<en=5>What s the easiest thing ?
<en=6>Well a changing bag would be the easiest solution .
<en=7>It 's light proof and makes sure you get no problems when opening the camera .
<en=8>You can work comfortably and make sure your film is not scratched etc .
<en=9>It 's really difficult to find a place that is absolutely dark and accessible to you when you 're outside .
<en=10>A changing bag folds neatly and does not take much space in your bag .
<en=11>A film changing bag is a handy way of unloading your exposed film in the field .
<en=12>Many online stores carry them , like Adorama :
