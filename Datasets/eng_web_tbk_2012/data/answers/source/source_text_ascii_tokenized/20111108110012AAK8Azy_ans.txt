<en=1>Bearded dragon question ... ?
<en=2>I just bought a baby one yesterday .
<en=3>I have a basking spot lamp that says it is a double reflector that focuses 35 % more light / heat and provides beneficial UVA rays important to the psycholical well - being of him .
<en=4>My question is does that mean it gives him not only the heat , but the " sun rays " he needs ?
<en=5>I also was wondering how long should this light be on .
<en=6>The lady at pet smart said 4 hours , but on places on the net it says 10 to 12 hours .
<en=7>He 's getting used to his new home , but has n't eatin yet .
<en=8>I have bearded dragon juvenile food and freeze - dried crickets .
<en=9>Any advice would be greatly appreciated .
<en=10>Thank you for your time .
<en=11>Let me try to break this down as simply as I can : diurnal ( active during the day time ) reptiles like the bearded dragon require 3 types of " light , " UVA , UVB , and heat .
<en=12>Any white light emitting light source will emit UVA , including heat bulbs , that 's the easy one to provide for .
<en=13>UVB on the other hand can only be reproduced by a fluorescent source .
<en=14>UVB will always be a separate bulb from the heat lamp , unless you use a MVB ( mercury vapor bulb ) which is the only reptile use bulb that will emit both UVB and heat from one bulb .
<en=15>I highly recommend that you do not use coiled / compact UVB bulbs as they are known to cause severe eye damage and / or blindness in reptiles not to mention they have trouble maintaining UVB output over time .
<en=16>The long tube UVB bulbs are best , like Zoomed 's Repsitun model : http://lllreptile.com/store/catalog/reptile-supplies/uvb-fluorescent-lights-mercury-vapor-bulbs/-/zoo-med-24-repti-sun-100-fluorescent-bulb/ Remember to replace UVB bulbs according to the manufacturer s recommendation after which time the bulb will no longer produce UVB even if visible light still is .
<en=17>So , to answer your question , no , if you just have a bulb that says it produces UVA then you do not have " the sun 's rays " that your bearded needs .
<en=18>You need to also provide a source a UVB lighting .
<en=19>The person at Petsmart is very wrong ; in fact it is always a good idea to second guess what most pet store employees tell you ; they do n't have the best track record regarding giving reliable pet care info .
<en=20>UVB and basking temp ( should be about 110 F for a baby , 95 F for an adult ) should be available for 10 - 12 hours a day .
<en=21>Freeze dried food is not a good staple food source ; you need to offer live feeder insects .
<en=22>Bearded dragons are sight hunters , they need to see the food move to trigger a feeding response , especially when they are babies .
<en=23>Live food is also higher in nutritional value than freeze dried .
<en=24>Crickets , silk worms , phoenix worms , and various feeder roaches , like red - lobster , turkistan , and dubia , are good example of staple insects to offer your bearded .
<en=25>Wax worms and meal worms should only be offered as treat items , for variety 's sake .
<en=26>I would highly recommend that you read through some reliable bearded guides to make sure you have everything set up correctly :

<en=29>mm it depends on the size of his tank or cage or whatever you have him in .. atleast as far as i 'm concerned .
<en=30>if there are shady areas he can move to ( for example a 3 x 5 x 4 tank with light on one side ) then you can leave it on a full 12 - 14 hours , if it s a small tank and he ca n't escape the light then 4 - 6 at most at a time though quite possibly 4 - 6 hours at a time twice a day .
<en=31>either way you also need to keep an eye on the temperature if you are using a dry fish tank as UV lights in my experience up the temperature significantly and without proper ventilation it can become an oven .
<en=32>as to what the light provides it gives UV rays .. which is important for health in lizards as it is in humans .
<en=33>That lady at PetSmart is a disgrace to the rest of us PetSmart associates ... sheesh .
<en=34>Yes , it gives him the " sun rays " necessary , that 's what UVA is .
<en=35>And it should be on 10 - 12 hours , just like the sun would be up for 10 - 12 hours in his natural environment .
<en=36>As for the heat , just be sure to use a thermometer .
<en=37>Also , Beardies often do not eat food that is not moving , so it s anyone 's guess whether or not he 'll touch the freeze - dried crickets or the processed food .
<en=38>I tell all my customers they can try it , but do n't count on it .
<en=39>Also try green leafy veggies , like kale and spinach .
<en=40>Best of luck !
