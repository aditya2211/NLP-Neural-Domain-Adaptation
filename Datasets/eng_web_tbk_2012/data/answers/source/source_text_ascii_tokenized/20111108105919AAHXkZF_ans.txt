<en=1>What is the typical lifespan of a cat ?
<en=2>My cat had a seizure yesterday and was ill .
<en=3>In fact every once in a while he seems to get ill in one way or another ; and then he bounces back like nothing has happened .
<en=4>I did an internet search to ascertain how long cats can live , however different sources give wildly different lifespans .
<en=5>My cat is 18 years old .
<en=6>In your experience how long do cats do cats typically live ?
<en=7>Is he on his last legs or is it conceivable that he could be around for another 15 years as is claimed by some of the sources i ve been looking at ?
<en=8>from my experience with my cats 13 - 18 years depending on the breed .
<en=9>At 18 years , your cat has had a long life .
<en=10>Indoor cats that are well cared for typically live 11 - 15 years .
<en=11>Older males often tend to have urinary tract issues , so your cat has done very well .
<en=12>Male cats very seldom live past 14 - 15 years .
<en=13>Stories of cats living more than 25 years are rare .
<en=14>I ve had cats for 35 years and the oldest cat I 've ever had was a 23 year old female and she was exceptional .
<en=15>By comparison , outdoor cats have a life expectancy of 3 - 7 years depending on how many predators are in the local environment .
<en=16>According to a couple sources , the world record for the oldest cat was a cat in Devon , England who reportedly live to the age of 36 .
<en=17>I knew a cat that died in its sleep aged 21 .
<en=18>Anything after 12 is a bonus .
