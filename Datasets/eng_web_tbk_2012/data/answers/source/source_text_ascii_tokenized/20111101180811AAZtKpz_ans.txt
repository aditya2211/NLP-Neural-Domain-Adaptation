<en=1>Better Steakhouse in Philadelphia ?
<en=2>I am taking my wife out for our first year wedding anniversary and we both agree that we want a good steak .
<en=3>We are staying at a hotel in Center City Philadelphia so I wanted something close .
<en=4>I have spent the afternoon looking around from menu to menu ...
<en=5>I have also looked at the photo galleries for an inside look at the decor of the restaurants and I have narrowed it down to three establishments .
<en=6>I have never been to any of these places so any suggestions and or advice would be most welcome .
<en=7>It 's narrowed down to Butcher and Singer , Davio 's , and Del Frisco s .
<en=8>Thanks in advance for the advice .
<en=9>Sidenote ... I am familiar with the Capital Grille , Barclay Prime , The Palm , The Prime Rib , Morton s , Ruth Chris ' , etc .
<en=10>I have weighed those options and found the three that I have chosen to be more my wife and my own taste .
<en=11>Please only reviews on the three I mentioned earlier .
<en=12>Many thanks .
<en=13>I am only familiar with Morton 's and Ruth Chris .
<en=14>I have never eaten at the ones you have listed nor do I know of anyone who has .
<en=15>I hope you get your answer .
<en=16>Anyway , have a lovely first anniversary !
