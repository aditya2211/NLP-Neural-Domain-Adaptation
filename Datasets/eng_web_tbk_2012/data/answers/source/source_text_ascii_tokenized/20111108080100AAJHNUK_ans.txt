<en=6>Any programs that you use please list :) Thx
<en=7>You could also try this in gimp .
<en=8>It will give you a lot more power , as well as control over how your black and white photo looks :
<en=9>Open your image while it 's still in color
<en=10>Create a new layer and fill the later with black .
<en=11>Set the layer mode to " color " this will make your image blak and white .
<en=12>Click colors >>> levels and adjust each channel 's color values .
<en=13>This will adjust the brightness and darkness of specific parts of an image .
<en=14>For more information on the theory behind later modes check out this gimp video tutorial : http://gimpedblog.blogspot.com/2011/09/gimp-video-tutorial-how-to-convert.html

<en=16>Hope this helps .
<en=17>Picasa is free and pretty good .
<en=18>But best is obviously photoshop CS5 or if you r on a macbook there s aperture :)
<en=19>depends what you want from " B & W " ... many programs will use a generic B & W ...
<en=20>try something like photoscape which has different options ...
