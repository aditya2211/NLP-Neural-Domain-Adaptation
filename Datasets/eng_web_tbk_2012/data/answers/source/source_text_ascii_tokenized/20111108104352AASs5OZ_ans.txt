<en=1>Fostering 6 week old kittens and HATING IT !
<en=2>Need Advice !?
<en=3>I wanted to volunteer and help animals , and decided to try fostering kittens .
<en=4>This is my first experience and I have two six week old kittens right now and am at my wit s end .
<en=5>I do not want to have to bring them back before they are eight weeks old but they are ruining my apartment .
<en=6>They track poop everywhere ( most disgustingly my bed .... ) , and am constantly trying to climb up everything , including my bare legs !
<en=7>My legs and hands are just full of scratches .
<en=8>I realize they are young and that cats do climb , but this is just ridiculous .
<en=9>My apartment also smells repulsive even though I am cleaning out their litter box at least once a day if not twice .
<en=10>Any suggestions and helpful hints to make this a more positive experience would be extremely appreciated .
<en=11>That 's kind of the way it goes .. lol .
<en=12>Limit them to one room with easy to clean flooring .
<en=13>If you have limited options , try the bathroom .
<en=14>Make sure there are plenty of litter boxes that are cleaned often .
<en=15>Depending on the batch of kittens , I will often have as many as one per kitten .
<en=16>They can produce a lot of waste and even scooping twice a day they can get messy .
<en=17>For some reason it takes them awhile to learn not to step in poop .
<en=18>Also if they have diarrhea , check in with your foster coordinator .
<en=19>They made need medication or deworming or something .
<en=20>They are testing out their claws and teeth .
<en=21>To some degree you can / should help teach them not to use their teeth and claws inappropriately .
<en=22>But in the meantime , highly recommend jeans and long sleeves anytime you 'll be interacting with the kittens .
<en=23>Then take care of yourself .
<en=24>Get plenty of sleep and make sure you take time out to do some things you enjoy .
<en=25>Try visiting the kittens a few times a day for short periods of time .
<en=26>Try to go in there with the right frame of mind and enjoy them for what they are .
<en=27>If you still do n't enjoy the kittens , see what other opportunities are available .
<en=28>They may need foster homes for adult cats in different situations .. sick , recovering from surgery , need a little socialization , etc .
<en=29>I find the adults are much easier .
<en=30>Generally they 're not clawing and biting , they do n't make nearly as much mess , they do n't need nearly as much litterbox scooping , etc :)
<en=31>Decide volunteering is not your thing and give them back !
<en=32>And do more research before you agree next time ;-)
<en=33>Take the kittens back to the shelter .
<en=34>Maybe do volunteer work at the humane society , walk dogs , groom the animals etc .
