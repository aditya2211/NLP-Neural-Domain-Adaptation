<en=1>Where can I go on a first date ( adults ) ?
<en=2>Looking for something on the casual side and we want it to be fun .
<en=3>May seem a little silly , but , taking a long ride on the Metra system or the " L " system is a great way to see the city and sites without spending a fortune .
<en=4>Or how about visiting the Chicago Botanical Gardens and see the change of colors and enjoy the air , They also have many inside exhibits you might enjoy , food is pretty good to .
<en=5>go 2 starbucks do nt spend more than 20 bucks :)
<en=6>Bike ride in the park , followed by coffee .
<en=7>You are busy , you do n't have to sit face to face to try
<en=8>to make convo , it 's short , so if things go great , you can
<en=9>extend , and if you want to end it , you just say bye ,
<en=10>got ta go .
