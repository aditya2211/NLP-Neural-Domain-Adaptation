<en=1>yoga and horses ..... ?
<en=2>I got a riding lesson today on one of my boss 's fino horses and it made me realize just how unsteady my left leg is .
<en=3>I mentioned it to my boss and she said to start doing yoga .
<en=4>But there are just so many poses and programs !
<en=5>Any good poses or programs ( I 'm willing to buy a dvd as long as it is under $ 20 ) to help specifically with leg stabilization ?
<en=6>I just have a few issues supporting my back and my left leg flops .
<en=7>Because I do n't feel like spending over $ 20 on a freakin DVD
<en=8>I also have back problems that transfer into my legs .
<en=9>I have done Yoga for riders for a while , a 20 minute routine I found on YouTube ( I think it s called " Yoga for horse back riding " hosted by a man ) It helped with noticing slight differences in my balance and weight distribution but not really for the way I use my legs and back .
<en=10>Here is what I do now and it really helps ....
<en=11>When I first get on I take 1 leg and pull it back up to touch my butt with my heel and hold it there for 1 lap at a walk around a large dressage arena .
<en=12>Then the same thing with the other leg .
<en=13>Then 1 lap at a walk around the arena with both my legs pulled out as far as I can , so they are not touching the saddle .
<en=14>Then a lap doing scissors , one leg forward as far as I can and the other back , then switch legs .
<en=15>I 'll also trot doing , down 2 beats , up one for a wile , then up 2 down 1 making sure the weight is going into the balls of my feet .
<en=16>If the weight is going into your heels ( it throws your leg forward ) put the stirrups up against the heel of your boot .
<en=17>Do a nice working trot , not a slow trot .
<en=18>All this will help you use both legs evenly , keep proper contact and use your wight correctly , to keep your leg in a good position .
<en=19>BTW you do nt want your leg locked in place , it will move WITH the horse a bit .
<en=20>When I first started doing it I 'd do it every day .
<en=21>Now I just do it once or twice a week or as needed .
<en=22>Now not only is my leg better , but my back is relaxing .
<en=23>what are you having problems with ?
<en=24>i would n't bother with yoga i 'd practice more with riding and fixing my problem , ride bareback , with no irons , there s also a way to ride on your knees ?
<en=25>that help alot with your thigh muscles ( bareback though )
<en=26>ya i really would n't bother with the yoga
<en=27>maybe a back brase will help , sometimes my back really gets to me and i 've thought about getting one .
<en=28>with your leg flopping , just try putting all your weight in your heel and hang on with only your legs , holding my leg back helps me with flopping the more it 's forward the more it flops :/ work your calf muscles , maybe try standing on the edge of your steps ( on the ball of your foot ) and balance to strengthen those muscles
<en=29>You do n't want to spend more than $ 20 and yet you have an expensive hobby like riding horses ?
<en=30>I really ca n't help you .
