<en=1>Pubs in Philadelphia ?
<en=2>Hey there , I 'm trying to find a restaurant in Philly to take my husband tomorrow for his birthday .
<en=3>He 's pretty much an " I love American Food , good drinks on occasion , laid back . " kind of guy . ;)
<en=4>I want to take him somewhere where there 's going to be awesome burgers / american food , atmosphere ( preferably a tavern / pub style would be nice ) , good service , and all around a great time . =)
<en=5>I 'm looking for suggestions from anyone who knows the philly area and the where to's .
<en=6>We just moved to a town outside Philly a couple of months back so I 'm not an expert on the area .
<en=7>A little help is always great . =)
<en=8>Thank you or your feed back .
<en=9>Oh my , you asked this question at the perfect time .
<en=10>Go to a local market or drug store , and buy this month 's copy of the " Philadelphia Magazine " .
<en=11>It is all about this very subject ... bars and food .
<en=12>It lists places all over the city and suburbs .
<en=13>Wishing your husband a happy birthday !
<en=14>If you 're looking for a good burger , some great fries ( they are too die for ! ) , and good drinks , go to Chickie & Pete 's !
<en=15>Oh my gosh , they are great !
<en=16>If you go , make sure you order the crab fries , you wo n't regret it :)
