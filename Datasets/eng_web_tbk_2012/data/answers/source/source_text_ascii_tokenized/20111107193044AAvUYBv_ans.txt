<en=1>I 'm mad and do n't know what to do !
<en=2>Please help !?
<en=3>Alright , so my dad had been wanting me to check my e mail for a few days but I never got around to it .
<en=4>( I just thought he wanted me to see one of those chain letter things again ) so I fineally checked it , and it was an e mail from southwest airlines telling me the flight dates for out family trip to Florida !!!
<en=5>I got so excited !!!!
<en=6>It said it was in January but still !!!!
<en=7>So I kept reading and then I saw the dates , it was from mid day Friday and arriving home mid day monday . :(
<en=8>then I think I just kind of stopped smiling and just kind of sat there looking at the dates .
<en=9>( we live in Pennsylvania btw ) I 'm mad and upset now !
<en=10>Do n't get me wrong I want to go , but for 2 days -_- I mean seriously .
<en=11>We are taking a 3 hour flight down to a fancy island in Florida and staying only 2 days .
<en=12>**** sigh **** not trying to sound snooty or stuck up but I mean really !
<en=13>Can someone please make me feel better about this trip !!!!
<en=14>A least you r going .!
<en=15>Enjoy those 2 days it better then not going at all .!
<en=16>and it will be fun 2 days cause you will busy going to a lot of beautiful places , i can afford to go so be happy you have the money to go . :D
<en=17>Well , I mean , you do n't have to be mad about it .
<en=18>At least you get to go to Florida in JANUARY .
<en=19>And , having only two days makes you realize what you have with your family .
<en=20>" Nothing Gold Can Stay " , honey .
<en=21>Enjoy it while you can , and then if your family enjoys it you can go again for a longer period of time .
<en=22>If they do n't like it , it 'll only be two days , remember ?
<en=23>Hope you have a crapload of fun !
<en=24>( In a good way ... )
