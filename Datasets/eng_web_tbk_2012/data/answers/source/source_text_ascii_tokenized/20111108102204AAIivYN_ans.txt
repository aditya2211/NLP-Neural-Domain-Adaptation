<en=4>no pet is really easy to take care of .
<en=5>they all need love and attn , food , proper surroundings etc .
<en=6>the easiest thing would be a fish - but u need to clean the tank weekly , feed it the right amt , etc etc x
<en=7>Having a pet is n't easy .
<en=8>You should treat all pets like children .
<en=9>They require a lot of attention or they get fussy and tear stuff up .
<en=10>If you want easy then go with a gold fish or hamster .
<en=11>I would go with a small rodent such as a mouse , rat , hamster or gerbil if you want something you can handle and hold .
<en=12>Fish are probably the easiest to take care of though .
