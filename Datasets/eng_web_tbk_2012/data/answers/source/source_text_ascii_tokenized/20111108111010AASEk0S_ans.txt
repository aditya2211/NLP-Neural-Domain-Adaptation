<en=1>is under tank heating or side tank heating better for a corn snake ?
<en=2>i was reading the package for a tank heater i bought for my 40 gallon tank for my snake and it said it can be put under the tank or on the side .
<en=3>i m not worried about damaging the surface my tank is on because i can prop it up off the surface anyway .
<en=4>from my understanding , if it s heated from the bottom , my snake risks burning its belly if it burrows and rests directly on top of the glass over the heater unless i buy some of that reptile carpet to put under the substrate , but it has better heat distribution
<en=5>if it s from the side i do nt have to worry about propping it up , but the snake can still burn itself if it slithers along the side of the tank and i also read that it does nt distribute heat as well ?
<en=6>what are your suggestions and opinons ?
<en=7>i use UTH's on all of my burrowing snakes .
<en=8>they will move if they get too warm - it 's not like a heat rock which you should avoid at all costs .
<en=9>i usually put my own natural rock over the UTH and they are perfectly fine .
<en=10>i have over 40 corns , kings , and milks and have never had a problem with the UTH system .
<en=11>on the side is a waste - leave it on the bottom .
<en=12>good luck !
<en=13>Bottom if you are worried about the snake burning itself put something overt it like newspaper ...
<en=14>I now use a 75 watt basking or heat bulb for mine and he seems to like it
<en=15>put the heater on the snake he will love it and the the next day you will have dinner
