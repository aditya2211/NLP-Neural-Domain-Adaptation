<en=1>Does a pacman absolutely need a uv lamp ?
<en=2>Or maybe something humid or heat ?
<en=3>I assume you are talking about a pacman frog .
<en=4>No , technically they do not need a UVB light ; they are nocturnal .
<en=5>However , it certainly would n't hurt if you wanted to provide one .
<en=6>A pacman frog will need a heat source that creates a basking temp in the upper 80's F for at least 10 - 12 hours a day .
<en=7>do n't forget to use a calcium supplement twice a week ; captive reptiles are prone to calcium deficiency .
