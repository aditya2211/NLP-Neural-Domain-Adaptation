<en=2>Iguazu Falls
<en=3>Widely considered to be one of the most spectacular waterfalls in the world , the Iguazu Falls on the border of Argentina and Brazil , are a certainly must see attraction in the area .
<en=4>The centre of the falls is known locally as ' Garganta Del Diablo ' ( The Devil 's Throat ) , where the huge volume of water sends a constant mist of spray into the air .
<en=5>With the sun shinning down on the spray , creating a rainbow in the foreground , this is the perfect place to get that trademark Iguazu Falls photograph .
<en=6>However , save some of your shots for the rest of the falls , as in total there are around 270 cascades that spread out over nearly 2 miles of the Iguazu River .
<en=7>The Iguazu Falls are easily accessible and , dependent on your time restrictions and budget , you can get to the area by either bus or plane .
<en=8>The nearest towns to the site are Puerto Iguazu in Argentina , about 12 miles from the falls , and Foz do Iguacu in Brazil , which is equally close .
<en=9>Both towns have airports that are served regularly from the larger cities such as Sao Paulo , Rio de Janeiro and Buenos Aires .
<en=10>The bus is obviously the cheaper option , and travelling up from Buenos Aires the trip is a full 20 hours , although the buses are very comfortable with spacious reclining seats .
<en=11>The bus trip down from Sao Paulo is a similar affair taking around 18 hours .
<en=12>Foz on the Brazilian side is the larger town , however both are geared up to cater for visitors to the Waterfalls and National Parks , and so offer a range of accommodation for all budgets .
<en=13>For those with a larger appetite for the scenery and a larger budget , there are some hotel complexes much closer to the action with views of parts of the falls .
