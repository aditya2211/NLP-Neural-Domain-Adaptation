<en=1>I just adopted a 2 year old male German Shepherd with Major bad behaviors ?
<en=2>Last night , I adopted a 2 year old Male German Shepherd .
<en=3>( He is 92 pounds ) He does not listen to any commands , but my major problem is that he will not go outside on command , or even with me .
<en=4>I will walk outside and he will stand at the door and stare at me or run away .
<en=5>My other MAJOR problem is that he will not get in his crate .
<en=6>I will get a treat and try to get him in there that way , it wo nt work .
<en=7>He wo nt even get close to the crate .
<en=8>If I come towards him , he will run away .
<en=9>How do I train him to feel comfortable in his crate ?
<en=10>and to willingly go outside ... and to come on command .
<en=11>He wo nt do anything on command .
<en=12>It s very frustrating .
<en=13>I have a 9 month old German Shepherd that I raised from a puppy .
<en=14>I trained her myself .
<en=15>She is crate trained , potty trained , and can sit , lay down , stay , come , fetch , and will even stay in a down position while I throw a treat across the floor or even right next to her paw , and she wo nt get it until I give her the command .
<en=16>Yes , lots of time and lots of patients ...
<en=17>I just do nt know how to do it with a grown dog .
<en=18>She tosses me around like it s nothing !
<en=19>... but basically , what I do is the same thing I did with my puppy ... lots of patience , lots of time , lots of praise , lots of treats , and lots of repition .... Right ?
<en=20>Is there any tricks I could use ?
<en=21>Maybe get a book on training .
<en=22>You have to be in command at all times .
<en=23>There are ways to get your new dog used to the crate or going out .
<en=24>I would start with a leash .
<en=25>Put the leash on the dog and just walk around the crate a few times .
<en=26>Then take the leash off and do nothing else but that .
<en=27>Later do it again .
<en=28>When the dog is ok with this , then open the door and walk around the crate , leave the door open all the time .
<en=29>Put something fun inside .
<en=30>Let your dog go in when he wants to for no reason .
<en=31>Do not shut the door .
<en=32>Let him walk in and out for a few days .
<en=33>At some point he will feel ok with this and you can then close the door but not for long at all .
<en=34>Open the door and let him out and see how he acts .
<en=35>If you push it , it will never work .
<en=36>With going outside , put the leash on and just take him for a walk .
<en=37>He will learn to really like this .
<en=38>Potty outside will come at some point .
<en=39>Try obedience classes .
<en=40>Have patience with him , you just got him and who knows how he was treated before you brought him home .
