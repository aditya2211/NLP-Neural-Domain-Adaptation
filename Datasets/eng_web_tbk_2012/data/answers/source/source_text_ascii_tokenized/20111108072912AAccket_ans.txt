<en=1>Change of boarding station ?
<en=2>How can I change my boarding station against the ticket I booked a month back from counter ?
<en=3>My origin Station is Howrah , but I want to board at Asansol ..
<en=4>Does your train pass Asansol when starting from Howrah ?
<en=5>If yes , you do n't need to change it because you board later .
<en=6>If no , you 'll have to go to one of the train stations .
<en=7>In Calcutta there is a Foreigner 's reservation office where they speak English very well .
<en=8>I do n't remember near which station it is though .
<en=9>They can help you and it is close to a train station in Calcutta so check a few big ones ?
<en=10>Even if you do n't find the foreigner 's office you 'll be fine in the normal Reservation Office of any big train station .
<en=11>This is where you can get AND change express train tickets .
<en=12>well if your desired boarding station comes after more than 2 or 3 halts of the actual boarding point , then the TC will cancel you ticket and allot the seat to others .
<en=13>so better inquire in railway office
<en=14>Contact the Indian railways .
<en=15>You might end up as a no show passenger .
