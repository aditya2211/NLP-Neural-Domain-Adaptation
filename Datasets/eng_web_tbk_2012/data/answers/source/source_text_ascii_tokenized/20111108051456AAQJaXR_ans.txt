<en=1>melting brass did not work ?
<en=2>my friends and I are trying to melt bras to make some little figures .
<en=3>we have made a furnace as such , we took a clay flower pot with a hole in the bottom put a piece of steel pipe in the middle of it with a cap on the bottom , filled the pipe with brass scrap , surounded the pipe with charcoal lit it off and pumped air through the hole in the pot , everything got red hot but did not melt .
<en=4>what am I doing wrong
<en=5>I would recommend to start with something more simple like tin , pewter , aluminum or zinc , they all have a much more reasonable melting point .
<en=6>I 'll just echo both other answers .
<en=7>Molten brass is damn hot and usually it 's pressurized gas and forced air or oxygen .
<en=8>Even if you did melt it , I doubt you foresaw the issues of handling it and pouring it .
<en=9>It 's really too advanced for a beginner , both in tooling and safety .
<en=10>Just the zinc fumes will get you , if you do n't take precautions .
<en=11>Pewter is perfect for what you are doing , and it melts on a stove top .
<en=12>I would recommend to start with something more simple like tin , pewter , aluminum or zinc , they all have a much more reasonable melting point .
<en=13>Brass has an even higher melting point than bronze and I would think your charcoal just does n't get hot enough .
<en=14>I bet you also did take charcoal as it is used for barbecue which does not get as hot as real coal ( e.g. for blacksmithing one needs coal , not barbecue charcoal ) .
<en=15>I have done a fair amount of metal casting , but never tried to build my own furnace , but I think your version is just too small and does n't get hot enough .
<en=16>I have melted small amounts of bronze in a crucible with a large propane torch ( much larger than the plumbers torch , but it can be run of those propane cylinders you can buy for a gas grill ) .
<en=17>I melt brass and cast it http://www.mikegigi.com/castgobl.htm
<en=18>Brass melts at just under 2000 F which is a bright yellow heat , not red hot .

<en=20>You might be able to make a version of your setup work , but it would take quite a bit of charcoal and a lot of forced air .
<en=21>I use propane with a blower and a burner I built http://www.mikegigi.com/meltmetl.htm and http://www.mikegigi.com/firehole.htm
