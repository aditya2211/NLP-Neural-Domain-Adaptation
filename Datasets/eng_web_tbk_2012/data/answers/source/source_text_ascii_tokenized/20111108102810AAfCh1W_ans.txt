<en=2>Do animals see images on a TV screen like humans do ?
<en=3>I 'm unsure of this , because once I watched a commercial of cat food with my cat and she did n't react to seeing another cat on TV .
<en=4>I heard that a company ( here is a link : http://news.yahoo.com/nestl-purina-releases-commercial-aimed-dogs-183443091.html ) is trying to make a dog food commercial aimed at dogs , complete with squeaky chew - toy sounds , and high pitched sounds that humans ca n't hear .
<en=5>As far as I understand , this ad will get dogs excited , but my question is : Can dogs actually see the images featured in the advert like humans ?
<en=6>Also , can animals remember images on TV like us , humans ?
<en=7>If so , then does that mean that if you watched a scary movie and your dog / cat / parrot was in the same room as you they will also get scared ?
<en=8>I would n't know -- I do n't particularly like scary movies , and I have n't tried this with my pet .
<en=9>Although , I do n't think that scary movies will affect pets for a long time ; I am sure they 'll forget sometime -- or am I wrong ?
<en=10>So what about T.V. ?
<en=11>Do dogs enjoy watching T.V. ?
<en=12>Well , T.V. is a series of flickering pictures that are streamed together to make a moving picture .
<en=13>The pictures are broadcast at a rate of about 60 Hz , which is how fast they need to move for us to see them as a moving , flawless picture .
<en=14>To a dog , watching T.V. is a lot like watching and old scratchy silent film because their flicker fusion seems to occur at a rate of 70 to 80 Hz .
<en=15>So they see the pictures flicker slower and there for it seems choppy to them .
<en=16>So chances are that if your dog likes to watch T.V. , it 's probably because of the sounds .
<en=17>Hearing is a dog 's secondary sense , and I will discuss that in another blog entery .
<en=18>Yes they do .
<en=19>i m pretty sure that they do see things on the tv screen because my cat chases things around the tv screen
