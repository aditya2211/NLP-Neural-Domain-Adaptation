<en=1>What are some fun things I could do while in Japan ?
<en=2>I 'll be in Okinawa for about a week so I was wondering what are some fun things I could do ?
<en=3>I 'm a 20 year old female travelling by myself so it could be anything .
<en=4>Besides the obvious tourist spots which I already have planned for .
<en=5>How is the night life in Naha ?
<en=6>Are there any good venues that showcase underground bands , or just a venue at all ?
<en=7>It does n't have to be underground it could be any type of music .
<en=8>Thanks
<en=9>The best thing you can do in Okinawa is to go to a beach .
<en=10>Otherwise , you can do what you can do in other parts or Japan , like shopping , eating , etc .
<en=11>Or you can visit temples or shrines in Okinawa .
<en=12>Well first you can try speaking Japanese .
<en=13>Go to a sumo tournament .
<en=14>Eat at a conveyor - belt sushi restaurant .
<en=15>Climb Mount Fuji .
<en=16>Okinawa is quite different from the rest of Japan , although of course there are similarities .
<en=17>The main thing people do there is go to the beach .
<en=18>There 's the market in Naha , which is great .
<en=19>You can find all sorts of fresh food and get a really delicious , fresh sashimi / sushi lunch upstairs .
<en=20>Try the local sake too if you can .
<en=21>It 's a special kind .
<en=22>I 'm not sure that there 's much nightlife in Naha .
<en=23>It 's more of a place to go to enjoy the weather , the sea , etc .
<en=24>You might have to make your own nightlife by finding an izakaya ( pub ) somewhere .
<en=25>Your best bet would probably be to get a copy of the Lonely Planet Japan book and read the chapter on Okinawa .
<en=26>Naha 's not a very big city .
