<en=1>does the POP drying time slow down if it not exposed to air ?
<en=2>it s for a craft project ..... i want to use it the way u would use icing ....
<en=3>took a bit of searching to discover that POP is probably PoP - plaster of Paris and yes plaster of Paris will slow way down if it is not exposed to air - in fact , if you are building up plaster ( " the way you would icing " ) to do sculpting , which is rather uncommon , you keep the set plaster damp in order to add more unset plaster or you have to wet the area where you will be adding plaster " mud "
<en=4>Plaster of Paris does two things
<en=5>- it chemically sets - gets warm to hot then cools down and hard and
<en=6>- it dries out , losing the water that is soaked into the set structure
<en=7>For example , a set plaster mold that is to be used for clay slip casting must be dry - it gets wet pulling the water out of the slip - while a set plaster mold used for molding wax must be soaking or damp wet http://www.mikegigi.com/castgobl.htm#LGGOBPROJ
