<en=1>Should the statue of David be censored ?
<en=2>I 'm a sophomore in high school doing a presentation on Italian Arts and my teacher is making us censor the Statue of David .
<en=3>My argument is it 's art and therefore should not be censored he 's making us censor it who 's right
<en=4>no , it 's only a body of a young man
<en=5>the city of florence did at one time in the past put clothes on the statue
<en=6>An art teacher in the mid-cities area of Dallas / Ft. Worth metro got fired because she took an art class on an approved field trip with parental permission for each student and some hysterical parent discovered that they saw " nudes " in the museum .
<en=7>You do n't think is was because of female nudes considering the nearly naked girls / women seen at pools and beaches and the completely naked manikins that show up in store windows in malls during changes in display ?
<en=8>No , it was guys .
<en=9>Your teacher knows what goes on in your community and wants to keep her job .
<en=10>Let her do it - argue when you are of age and can battle the other adults in your community - skipping of course telling your boss he / she is a prudish ignoramus because you want to keep your job .
