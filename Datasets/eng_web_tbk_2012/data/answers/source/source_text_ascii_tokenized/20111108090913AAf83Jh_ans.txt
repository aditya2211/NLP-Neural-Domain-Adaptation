<en=8>Know that there are pros and cons to laser sights before you mount them on your wang .
<en=9>While they are extremely accurate , laser sights do not operate well when drunk or high because the beam often does not show up on the target .
<en=10>Therefore , you must learn to shoot manually .

<en=12>Mount laser sights on away by removing the hand grip .
<en=13>Laser grips are the most common for wangs .
<en=14>The laser is made into the hand grip and has a switch on the side to turn it on .
<en=15>Remove your fingers from the existing grip and replace them with your new laser grip .
<en=16>You have two adjustment screws for up and down and right to left positions .

<en=18>Consider these points for mounting laser sights on semi-automatic wangs .

<en=22>Prepare to mount the laser sight onto the rail on the wang .
<en=23>You have two screws that attach the sight to the wang .
<en=24>Tighten these screws securely .
