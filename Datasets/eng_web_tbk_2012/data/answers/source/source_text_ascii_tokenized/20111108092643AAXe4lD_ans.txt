<en=1>Is a finch or a parakeet better ?
<en=2>I am making a christmas list for my parents and i was going to ask for a bird and these are the affordable ones that i like , and i was wondering : which would not bite alot , and which are more fun to have as pets AND I NEED TO KNOW WHICH WOULD BE QUIETEST i honestly do nt care but my family does !
<en=3>Please help me !
<en=4>oh and please say y one is better thx !!!!!!
<en=5>Hi there ,
<en=6>Please choose the parakeet ...
<en=7>Here s my reason .....
<en=8>I did the same thing that you did for christmas .
<en=9>I ended up getting a pair of zebra finches for christmas .
<en=10>At first it was all cool and all .
<en=11>They were chirping and doing their every day business .
<en=12>After a couple of weeks I got tired of them .
<en=13>They are quite messy and you can not hold or pet them .
<en=14>I ve tried to tame them and they just would not get tamed .
<en=15>They do nt want to be held or touched .
<en=16>I want a bird that I can hold and do tricks .
<en=17>I still have them and they are doing well .
<en=18>A couple of months after I got parakeets / budgies .
<en=19>They are adorable they have beautiful colors and personality .
<en=20>I love them .
<en=21>First of all they are very tame .
<en=22>I tamed them in 4 days .
<en=23>They can do tricks and they are nt messy .
<en=24>The whole family loves them .
<en=25>My parents even plays with them .
<en=26>They are a big part of our family .
<en=27>I hope this helps you with your decision .
<en=28>They are both about the same noise level .
<en=29>When choosing a parakeet look for a young one .
<en=30>( the younger the eaiser to tame ) Look for clean smooth feathers , beak , and clean vent feathers ( the feathers around the butt .. dirty vent feathers means the bird is not healthy ) Look for a dark eye with no circles ( the older ones have a circle ring in their eyes ) .
<en=31>Look for a lot of stripes in their head that starts from the beak and goes back to the back fo the bird .
<en=32>the stripes are like hair the less stipes the older .
<en=33>( think of a balding man lol ) Look for clean feathers .
<en=34>If you want a boy the cere ( the nostrils piece above the beak ) must be blue .
<en=35>The girl has either pink or brown .
<en=36>I would recommend that you get two parakeets .
<en=37>But get either one male and one female , or two males .
<en=38>Do not get two females .
<en=39>They sometimes do nt get along ( you know how some girls are lol hahahaahh but for real though , two girls tend to fight a lot .
<en=40>I have one yellow girl and a green and yellow boy .
<en=41>They are the best !
<en=42>If you choose to get a parakeet this is a trick that I used to tame them .
<en=43>However if you plan on getting one , then get more than one at the same time they need company .
<en=44>My mom told me how to tame them and I was very happy with the results .
<en=45>It took me 4 days to get the new one to be able to step on and eat out of my hand .
<en=46>These are the steps I used .
<en=47>Honestly they have worked for me twice with my parakeets .
<en=48>Hopefully they will work for you .
<en=49>1 ) When you get the bird , place him or her or them in the cage .
<en=50>Leave them in there with food and water and such for about 2 hours .
<en=51>2 ) Then place you hand in the cage .
<en=52>I took the cage and place it next to the couch .
<en=53>Then I sat on the couch , placed one hand in the cage , holding a millet spray .
<en=54>( this way the will associate your hand with food , and birds love food lol ) Then I turned on the tv and watch .
<en=55>This way they will see that your hand is good and it s not going to grab them or hurt them .
<en=56>Do this for about one hour .
<en=57>( you can take breaks if you have too ) and repeat the steps after about 2 hours .
<en=58>3 ) After about day 2 , they will start to eating the millet spray from your hand .
<en=59>( do not take away the food dish from the birds , they will associate you as the person who takes away their food ) ....
<en=60>Then take your finger and place it under their belly , in front of their feet and say up .
<en=61>Push you finger to their feet gently and say up .
<en=62>( the first couple of times they will fly all over the cage but as long as you do nt jump back or screem they will get used to you ) They will have no choice but to go on your finger .
<en=63>When they see that you ar nt harming them , the will go up on your finger when you say up .
<en=64>4 ) If they are not going up by now you just got ta keep trying and keep trying .
<en=65>Do not hit , yell , or harm them .
<en=66>You have patience .
<en=67>Do nt give up !
<en=68>After a couple of weeks mines knows when I say shoulder it means ot go on my sholder , when I say up it means to jump up on my finger , when I say up and out it means up on my finger and out of the cage .
<en=69>and when I say go home it means to go in the cage .
<en=70>Good luck !
<en=71>They worked for me and I hope they worked for you !
<en=72>They are awesome !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
<en=73>And that s my reason why you should choose a parakeet over a finch .
<en=74>a parakeet is friendlier
<en=75>Parakeet .
<en=76>They are normally quiet and it is easy to take care of them .
<en=77>They are also friendly .
<en=78>I have a parakeet named Cookie . :P
