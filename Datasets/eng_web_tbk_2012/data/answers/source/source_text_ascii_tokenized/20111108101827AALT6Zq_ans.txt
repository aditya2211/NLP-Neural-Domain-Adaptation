<en=1>I want to apply for canada skilled immigeration program .
<en=2>I got only 63 points while 67 minimunm is requirement .?
<en=3>Can i apply with 63 points ?
<en=4>According to the Citizenship and Immigration Canada web site at http://www.cic.gc.ca/english/immigrate/skilled/assess/index.asp , it states " Note : you must meet the minimum requirements for your application to be eligible for processing . "
<en=5>HOWEVER ... that same web page also states that " The current pass mark is 67 .
<en=6>The pass mark could change .
<en=7>You should check for updated information on a regular basis . "
<en=8>The Skilled Worker category was my first attempt at permanent residency .
<en=9>And between the time I began my research and the time I applied , the minimum score did change once .
<en=10>Unfortunately , both minimums were above my score .
<en=11>But I got lucky because I qualified under another category to become a permanent resident .
<en=12>So keep checking at least on a weekly basis .
<en=13>GOOD NEWS ... I found a web page run by Canadian Immigration Lawyers at http://www.canadavisa.com/canadian-immigration-faq-skilled-workers.html .
<en=14>Here is what they posted there
<en=15>" 4 . May I qualify under the Skilled Worker category even if I score less than 67 points ? "
<en=16>" If the Canadian Immigration Visa Officer believes that the point total does not accurately reflect your ability to become economically established in Canada , the Canadian Immigration Visa Officer may use his or her positive discretion ( referred to as substituted evaluation ) and approve your application even though you score less than 67 points . "
<en=17>Read the full answer at that web page for conditions .
<en=18>Sure you can apply .
<en=19>The points system acts as a guide to sort out the best candidates .
<en=20>Your application is still evaluated on a number of criteria , not all of them as " cast in steel " as the points .
<en=21>Go ahead , send in your application .
<en=22>NOTE to BEN .
<en=23>67 is the minimum score , anything below that is filed in the " circular file basket " .
<en=24>Why have a " minimum " if it is going to be ignored ?
