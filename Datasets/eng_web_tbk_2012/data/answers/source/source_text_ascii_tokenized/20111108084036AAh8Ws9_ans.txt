<en=1>Will USB cell phone chargers still charge even if they 're hooked up to a computer that is turned off ?
<en=2>Mine does .
<en=3>I have the HTC Evo .
<en=4>depends on the computer
<en=5>if the computer is completely shut off , the USB ports are n't getting power , so they wo n't charge your phone
<en=6>many PCs have sleep & charge now , that allow the PC to go into sleep mode , and still allow the USB ports to charge things like phones .
