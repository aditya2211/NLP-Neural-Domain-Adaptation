<en=1>what is the fall of hanoi ?
<en=2>can anyone tell me exactly what it is and what took place ?
<en=3>I ca nt find any information about it
<en=4>When the French returned to Indochina at the end of WW II the Viet Minh were in control of the Red River Delta .
<en=5>They chased the Communists out of the capital ( Hanoi ) and retook control .
<en=6>Is that what you are referring to ?
<en=7>You need to check out the French Indochina War ( 1946 - 1954 ) not the Vietnam War ( 1957 - 1975 ) .
