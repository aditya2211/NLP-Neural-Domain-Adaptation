<en=1>French dating etiquette ?
<en=2>I would really love to hear what the French or those who had dated the French to say something about this .
<en=3>I 'm in my 20's and currently studying in France .
<en=4>Coming from an anglo - saxon country my version of dating is ' getting the number , asking her out , etc. . '
<en=5>However , I 've read on the internet that the French dating etiquette is totally different .
<en=6>For them , dating would normally be meeting in groups or parties , then pairing off .
<en=7>In addition , from my understanding one - on - one dates is something that comes much later and not ' straight - away ' like us anglo - saxons .
<en=8>They are also very secretive about being in a relationship .
<en=9>They only ' go out in the open ' once they have reached a certain level of seriousness .
<en=10>Is it true ?
<en=11>I have told a French girl I liked her , and she accepted .
<en=12>She is friendly when we see each other on campus .
<en=13>She is also nicer when we are both alone .
<en=14>However , when we are at parties or when they are people around she seems to ignore me .
<en=15>She also seems to hate it whenever I ask her out on a date , to the point she said stop !
<en=16>My mind thinks she has no interest in me and just stringing me along .
<en=17>But the articles I read seemed to say the contrary .
<en=18>Have I just fallen victim in a cultural trap ?
<en=19>What you have read in the internet is fairly accurate but of course it does not fit all scenarios .
<en=20>You are not French for a start , so the " rules " or " customs " may not apply to you when it comes to entering into a relationship between people from different backgrounds .
<en=21>From what you say the messages given by this girl are quite clear .
<en=22>She is not stringing you along since she is actually discouraging you and is honest enough to tell you to stop asking her out .
<en=23>She is just being friendly in public because she does not want to offend you and she treats you like any other friend .
<en=24>You said you liked her and she accepted it as a truth and perhaps as a compliment , but it does not mean she fancies you or wants to pair off with you .
<en=25>At parties she does not want to be considered in any way attached to you , which is consistent .
<en=26>Take the messages for what they are : she has no objection in you being pals at uni , but she does not want to take matters further .
<en=27>" Non ! " means " non " , not " I might consider it , and I will keep you attached to my apron strings just in case . "
<en=28>Christiane gave you a good answer .
<en=29>You have fallen in a cultural misunderstanding .
<en=30>What I have to add is that it is normal in France to have mixed gender groups of friends , there 's nothing unusual in boys and girls being only friends , which is obviously what this girl wants from you .
<en=31>She probably finds your company pleasing as a friend but you are not her choice a a boyfriend and she is trying to keep it on a friendship level , and trying to make you understand that she does n't want to go further .
<en=32>If she is nicer when you are alone I 'd say it is because in public view she is making sure that people do not think that you might be her boyfriend .
<en=33>You do find the ' get the number hop in bed with her ' but be aware that they usually have a reputation as sluts .
<en=34>Unfair for the girl as boys do n't have that kind of handicap , but that 's the way our own rules work .
<en=35>Should have done research before you left .
<en=36>Why not just take your chances and do it your way ?
