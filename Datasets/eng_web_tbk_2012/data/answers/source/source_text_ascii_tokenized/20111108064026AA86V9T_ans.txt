<en=1>What sort of Hotel could I expect to find in New Delhi / Agra / Varanasi for rs 500 per night ?
<en=2>Hey guys .
<en=3>I 'm looking to visit India with some mates at the beginning of February next year and I am wandering what standard of accommodation we could get for Rs 500 per person per night .
<en=4>There would be four of us so we would probably be looking at 2 twin rooms for Rs 1000 , close to the centre of these cities .
<en=5>This would be on a walk - in basis as we want to have the freedom of finding a place that looks good ( Not relying on pictures from the internet ) and is in a spot we like .
<en=6>Thanks in advance for sharing your experience !
<en=7>Sorry , almost forgot to ask - Would it be cheaper to walk - in to these hotels rather than pre book ?
<en=8>In Delhi I 'd recommend Ajay Guesthouse .
<en=9>Travelled to Delhi twice and stayed there twice .
<en=10>Rooms start from 500 per double .
<en=11>Those ones are quite small .
<en=12>Must say , in Delhi it 's hard to get good price / quality rating .
<en=13>I have found this hotel in the Lonely Planet guide .
<en=14>It 's in an area starting with a P , many tourist hotels there and the location is very nice .
<en=15>But in general , Delhi is the hardest place to find a nice clean hotel for that price .
<en=16>In Varanasi I do n't know .
<en=17>I 've stayed in a more expensive hotel there , but you can check some travelguides or tripadvisor ?
<en=18>Also , while travelling ask people where they 've been and if they have any hotel recommendations .
<en=19>In Agra I 've stayed in a place fellow travellers recommended , they found it in the Rough Guide .
<en=20>It was nice and close to the Taj .
<en=21>It was quite easy to find something .
<en=22>( Do nt stay in Agra too long .
<en=23>One night is enough ! )
<en=24>There were many hotels there .
<en=25>I ve paid 500 for a double room there and it was fine and clean .
<en=26>Good luck , enjoy your time !
