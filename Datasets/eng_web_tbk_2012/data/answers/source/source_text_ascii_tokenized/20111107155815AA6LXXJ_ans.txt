<en=1>out of carnival , royal caribbean , and norweigan ( cruises ) which is the best and why ?
<en=2>I prefer Royal Caribbean out of all these .
<en=3>There is so much to do onboard .
<en=4>The new NCL Epic does sound amazing , although I have n't sailed on her yet .
<en=5>None of the above .
<en=6>Of THESE three , it 's a toss - up between Royal and Carnival .
<en=7>NCL is a notch below either , in terms of quality and service .
