<en=1>I decided to get a 150 gal aquarium , what can I fill it with ?
<en=2>I was thinking cichlids ?
<en=3>Possibly a freshwater tank with a ton of different species in there .
<en=4>I 've never kept cichlids though .
<en=5>I know saltwater is a possibility , can you give me a possible stocking option for that too ?
<en=6>I 'll choose the one that sounds the best after looking into all the fish :)
<en=7>Here is the stocking for my 150 gallon tank i upgraded it to 200 at the weekend because of the clownloach A 200 gallon with 6 pairs of Breeding Angel fish fire mouth honey Gouramis 5 8 inch clownloach a Krib and 5 1 inch clown loach with 16 cory cats 5 Australian Rainbows
<en=8>If you took out the clown loach it would make a nice 150 gallon tank .
<en=9>fill it with water :) lol
<en=10>for a tank that size i would suggest oscars or piranha every time awesome fish !!
