<en=1>I found an injured pure white bird ( dove I guess ? )
<en=2>what do I feed it ?
<en=3>I found this pure white bird in my neighborhood , its wing is injured , so I 'm currently taking care of it .
<en=4>It 's pure white , no marks or streaks or anything , I do n't know what type of bird it is , probably a dove ?
<en=5>What should I feed it ?
<en=6>Is normal bird food fine ?
<en=7>( Because apparently my mom is very picky , she says the bird might get sick if it does n't eat the right food ) IS there any specific food I might find at any pet shop ?
<en=8>( petco , petsmart ) ..... thanks !
<en=9>Doves are a species of pigeon , they are Seed eaters , they do not eat bread , or worms .
<en=10>make sure that you have a shallow dish of water for it .
<en=11>as they can drink a lot .
<en=12>there 's these little like bait worms at jack s . petshoppe .
<en=13>it s jack s aquarium and pets I believe . ?
<en=14>anyways I feed them to my road sometimes .
<en=15>like a little container .
<en=16>or buy small bait worms .
<en=17>that should work
<en=18>If you have a pet store near buy some wheat , pigeon corn or even mixed bird seed will do , but do not feed bread .
