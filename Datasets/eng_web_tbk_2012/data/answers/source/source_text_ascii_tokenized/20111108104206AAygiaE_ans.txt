<en=1>Should all UK towns and their cafes or restaurants provide Halal food ?
<en=2>Some friends of mine visited Dartmouth in Devon whilst on holiday last summer .
<en=3>They could not find any cafes or food shops that provided Halal prepared foods .
<en=4>It s important to their religion that they only consume Halal food .
<en=5>Even if you buy a cake in a baker s you can not be too what happens in the kitchen , for example the cake may have been sliced using a knife used for preparing ham .
<en=6>It s simply not just a case of avoiding pork , alcohol and only being allowed to eat halal prepared meat , but the kitchen and its utensils should not have been used for prohibited foods .
<en=7>Places like Dartmouth are supposed to be tourist towns and should provide foods for people of all religions .
<en=8>We all enjoy buying a snack when visiting a town or attraction while on holiday .
<en=9>Not everyone wants to bring packed lunch .
<en=10>It s not fair if some people have to go without buying food because no place will provide suitable food for them .
<en=11>I think it s only fair that nowadays every town should provide at least one halal cafe or restaurant and hopefully one day every British catering establishment will be halal .
<en=12>When I went to Bosnia , all the meat was Halal .
<en=13>I will not eat halal meat , so guess what , I opted for foods which were n't a meat dish , there were plenty of other options .
<en=14>I could not go to their country and demand they slaughter and sell an animal as meat the way I prefer to eat it .
<en=15>When you go to another country , you live by their way of life and their laws , if you do n't like it , you know how to get back out the country ( but I guess our benefits system is too much to throw away , huh ) .
<en=16>Cafes and restaurants rarely use the same cutlery for different food groups anyway , they normally have blue for bakery items , red for cooked meat , brown for raw meat , etc - all for food preparation and hygiene policies .
<en=17>No .
<en=18>To prevent animal cruelty , many countries forbid Halal and Kosher meat .
<en=19>Switzerland is one , and the Netherlands are passing the same law .
<en=20>It will become EU law in a couple of years .
<en=21>We ca n't dictate what business wants to open where .
<en=22>If someone thinks there is a business opportunity then they will start opening halal only places .
