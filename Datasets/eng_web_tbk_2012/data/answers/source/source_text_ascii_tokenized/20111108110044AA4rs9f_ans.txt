<en=1>my Tom cat will not eat meat just the juice in the can .?
<en=2>When I open a can of meat with gravy he licks off the gravy and lets the meat lay .
<en=3>I must through it away .
<en=4>Why ?
<en=5>If you knew what kind of " meat " they put in canned cat food you 'd understand this .
<en=6>I 've had a lot of cats who refused to eat the canned food .
<en=7>When you read the label it s easy to understand why .
<en=8>I 've had cats for 35 years and I only feed them dry food .
<en=9>They have done very well and like the dry food better .
<en=10>It had better nutritional value and it s also less expensive .
<en=11>Canned food is often suspect as to the actual contents and you 're paying for a high moisture content instead of food content .
<en=12>There are a lot of good quality dry cat foods .
<en=13>Read the labels for contents .
<en=14>Your cat will adjust quickly .
<en=15>You 'll also have less spoilage .
<en=16>He might be sick take him to the vet to see
<en=17>If he always does this , welcome to the club .
<en=18>My oldest female and youngest male do this - I just grab the blender and pop in some other stuff for them like chicken liver ( cooked ) for the anemic one , some arthritis stuff for the oldest .
<en=19>Even if you mash it with a spoon he ca n't do that ,
