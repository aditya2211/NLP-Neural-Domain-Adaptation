<en=1>I have a western pleasure appy that s really heavy on her left lead at the lope ?
<en=2>My appy is very heavy on her left lead at the lope .
<en=3>She seems to lope one stride and trot the next and repeat ...
<en=4>How could I work with her to get off her four hand , get balance , and lope smoothly and slowly ??
<en=5>Put on a pair of spurs and before she makes that trot step , it 's in the feeling when you feel her think trot , tick her with the spur and lift with your body to keep her moving .
<en=6>If you concentrate on that feel just before the trot you can figure it out and the timing is essential to push her at that instant .
<en=7>Lope her to the left in circles , keep her head to the inside of the circle and push her but out , keep doing this if she breaks to a jog go a little bit bigger circle , till she can get enough balance to go small and small . circles
