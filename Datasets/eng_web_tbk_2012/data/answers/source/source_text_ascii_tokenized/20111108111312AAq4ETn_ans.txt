<en=1>What to feed my dog after gastroenteritis ?
<en=2>My dog has been sick for about 3 days now .
<en=3>He has been having diarheya everywhere and he began to vomit last night .
<en=4>I thought it would pass until he started to vomit blood and would nt drink any water .
<en=5>I took him to the Animal Hospital and they ran blood work and everything came back normal .
<en=6>No pancreatitis or anything abnormal .
<en=7>The vet said it was gastroenteritis and gave him fluids under his skin , an injection of nausea medication along with some take home antibiotics .
<en=8>So my question is ..
<en=9>Is it normal for dogs to throw up blood while having gastroenteritis ?
<en=10>and will these antibiotics help ?
<en=11>I have tryed to give him water but he wo nt take it .. what should i do ?
<en=12>i do nt want him to get dehydrated and also should i try to give him a little bit of food ?
<en=13>... Some help would be great .
<en=14>thank you :)
<en=15>They did nt take x - rays they offered them but i just could nt afford any more treatment .
<en=16>I feel like shit for saying that but after what they have done already i wo nt be buying grocerys for the next few weeks .
<en=17>I will give them and call and see what they say .
<en=18>Thank you for the help .
<en=19>Ok so i spoke to the vet and he said the give him white rice and boiled chicken but only a little at a time .
<en=20>Seince he recieved the fluids last night he said not to worry about drinking water for at least a couple of days .
<en=21>I went home at lunch to check on him and he is doing 1000 etter he was actually walkin around and wagin his tail :) thanks everbody for the info it s greatly appreciated .
<en=22>To answer your questions in order :
<en=23>1 ) It is not normal for dogs to be vomiting , much less to have blood in it .
<en=24>However , if they have been vomiting numerous times , then the blood could be due to irritation of the stomach and intestines .
<en=25>He could also have Parvovirus , a GI foreign body , or any number of things .
<en=26>Did your vet take radiographs ( x - rays ) ?
<en=27>2 ) Your vet would not prescribe them if they did n't think it would be helpful .
<en=28>3 ) If he shows no interest in water , then take him back to your vet .
<en=29>It could be due to nausea or any number of things .
<en=30>He could become severly dehydrated ( especially if he continues to vomit and have diarrhea ) .
<en=31>From there you end up with electrolyte imbalances , which can lead to heart and kidney problems .
<en=32>And being dehydrated , vomiting , and having diarrhea just does n't feel good .
<en=33>4 ) Call your vet .
<en=34>They should have discussed a bland diet with you , including the frequency of feeding and how much to feed at each sitting .
<en=35>It sounds like your dog may benefit from being hospitalized , and put on IV fluids to help his hydration , administer the antibiotics IV , and to ensure that he starts to recover .
<en=36>You should ABSOLUTELY call your veterinarian back immediately to clarify anything you have questions about .
<en=37>They have seen your pet , and are most aware of his condition .
<en=38>No one online will be able to assist you more than your vet can .
<en=39>You need to ask your vet these questions .
<en=40>Boiled WHITE rice and boiled chicken breast .
<en=41>Bland food .
<en=42>NO SPICES !
<en=43>My vet told me when a dog is vomiting a lot , it could be a sign of obstruction .
<en=44>Did they do any x - rays ?
<en=45>I do n't know if vomiting blood is common with this ailment .
<en=46>You should call your vet now and ask them what is normal or not .
