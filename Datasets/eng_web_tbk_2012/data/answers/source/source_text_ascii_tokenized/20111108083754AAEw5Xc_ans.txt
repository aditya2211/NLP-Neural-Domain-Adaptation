<en=1>Do they have this anywhere ?
<en=2>I want to take a cruise around the world .
<en=3>I mean literally around the world if possible .
<en=4>First of if i went alone on a regular cabin how much would you estimate it would be just a guess .
<en=5>Second is there any way to sort of customize the places you wan na go to ?
<en=6>Like you can pick the destinations ?
<en=7>But if not just say no but i hope there is like one out there somewhere .
<en=8>1 . Here 's a site that lists world cruises including prices .
<en=9>http://www.cruisecompete.com/specials/regions/world/1
<en=10>Prices listed , however , are usually based on two people in a cabin , and you will likely face some high " single supplement " costs in addition .
<en=11>( Two people in a cabin will spend more onboard , so cruise lines charge you more to sail alone .
<en=12>You may be able to do better on the rates if you request competitive quotes via CruiseCompete ) .
<en=13>2 . Short of chartering your own ship and crew , I do n't see any way you could customize your own itinerary .
<en=14>Good luck !
<en=15>Various world cruises from most of the major cruise lines , typically 100 days in duration .
<en=16>Travelling on your own you would have to pay double as cabins are sold on the basis of double occupancy .
<en=17>No possibility to customise ports of call .
<en=18>Prearranged about 18 months in advance as the cruise lines sell segments all along the way i.e Transatlantic to London ( England ) , England to Barcelona ( Spain ) , Barcelona to Alexandria ( Egypt ) , Egypt to India via Suez canal etc .
<en=19>yes there are multiple around the world cruises , mainly offered by the more upscale lines .
<en=20>HOWEVER : you will pay as if there are 2 people in the cabin , even if it is just you .
<en=21>so any price you find , DOUBLE IT figure , $ 40 K at least .
<en=22>and no you can not customize an itinerary unless you book several different legs of a cruise with stops in between on shore .. say book a Panamal Canal crossing , then fly to Asia and pick it up again and sail to India then fly to Europe to sail the Med before flying to England to hit the Transatlantic corssing .
