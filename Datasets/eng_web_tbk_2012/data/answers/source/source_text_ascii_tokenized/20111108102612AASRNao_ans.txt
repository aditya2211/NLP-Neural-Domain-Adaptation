<en=1>What 's the difference between Indian and African ringnecks and alexandrine parrots ? ?
<en=2>I was fixing to buy an indian ringneck , did a bunch of research , ( I 'm a very experienced bird owner , macaws , cockatoos , amazons ) ,
<en=3>And noticed two other breeds that look a lot alike .
<en=4>So does anyone know what the difference is ?
<en=5>Thanks
