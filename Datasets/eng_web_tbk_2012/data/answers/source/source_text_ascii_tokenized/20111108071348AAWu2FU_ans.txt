<en=1>french male sensuality ?
<en=2>I ve been dating a man from brittany france for a couple of months now .
<en=3>He 's been away for a week and I was thinking of waiting for him in his apartment wearing only his dress shirt .
<en=4>It s still a fairly new relationship and we have nt had sex yet so it s kind of a big deal .
<en=5>I just do nt want to freak him out or make him feel uncomfortable .
<en=6>Is it ok for a woman in french culture to make the first move ?
<en=7>What do french men find sexy ?
<en=8>French women are the ones to say yes , the way we say it is not usually as straigthforward as you propose to do .
<en=9>Why not wait for him in a sexy dress with lunch or dinner , or a light snack at his house .
<en=10>And you take it up from there .
<en=11>Just make sure that it is a light meal with little alcohol .
