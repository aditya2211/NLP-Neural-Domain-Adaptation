<en=2>Hi , I want to get a few pet rats and need a rat cage .
<en=3>( Apart from the wire flooring which i am going to cover ) Which of these two cages is better :

<en=6>I ca nt decide between height or width .

<en=8>This one is better for rats .
<en=9>You always want to go higher rather than wider for rats .
<en=10>They LOVE to climb .
<en=11>You will have to cover the wire flooring like you said , and make fleece covers for the stairs , so no ratty feet get caught and broken .
<en=12>This cage will hold about 2 - 3 rats .
<en=13>Both are equal length so go for the taller one .
<en=14>If you use this cage it 's best to remove the wire shelves altogether and replace it with hammocks and the like .
<en=15>I used one of these cages short term for a pet and it was n't that great to be honest , pretty cheaply made , the door springs are annoying and it does n't last very well .
<en=16>Here are some better options IMO :

<en=22>These are all a bit more expensive than your choice but if you ebay search the names you may be able to find one second hand ... better paying for a second hand one in good condition than a poorly made new one IMO .
<en=23>The First One Is much Better !
<en=24>I Have This Exact Cage , Bought From The Exact Ebay User .
<en=25>It s Really Good And The Rat Calculater Says Is Big Enough For 5 Rats , But I Would Put A Maximum Of 4 In It Really :)
