<en=1>HAMSTERS - will a hamster be ok living in the bathroom ?
<en=2>in his cage in the bathroom ?
<en=3>or would the steam from the shower be a problem ?
<en=4>thanks d
<en=5>If space is minimal , or you are keeping him in there to be kept away from other pets , then I can understand why you would choose to keep him there .
<en=6>There are some things to consider though ...
<en=7>Rodents require special bedding in their cages to absorb their waste , and this needs to be cleaned regularly , or your hamster could suffer from problems due the buildup of ammonia from his urine .
<en=8>When you take a warm shower and build up steam , his cage will collect water , the bedding will absorb much of it , and will not be able to absorb the urine quite as it should .
<en=9>You will also have to be wary of mold forming on any toys or hide - aways he may have .
<en=10>You also do n't want it getting too warm for him too often .
<en=11>Overall , it is not a good solution , but you can keep him healthy and pull it off if you take the time to give him the extra care he will need because of it .
<en=12>It may be a problem because the temperature is constantly changing .
<en=13>I would personally put him somewhere else .
