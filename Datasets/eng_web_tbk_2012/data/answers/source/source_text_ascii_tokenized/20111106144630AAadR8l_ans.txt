<en=1>Modern m 16 vs Vietnam m 16 version ?
<en=2>I was playing a video game that has a m 16 Vietnam model , and in the game it 's 3 - shot burst .
<en=3>My brother said they only had full - auto and semiautomatic during Vietnam .
<en=4>My questions are ..
<en=5>1 ) what the s difference between a modern m16 and Vietnam m 16 ?
<en=6>2 ) did Vietnam m 16's have a 3 - shot burst function ?
<en=7>To save money Robert McNamara ordered that the ammunition for the new M - 16s being sent to SEA in the early 60s use an older ( dirtier ) type of gunpowder meant for use with the M - 14 .
<en=8>He also ordered that the receiver not get a ( I think chrome ) coating that helped keep the gun from jamming .
<en=9>Than the troops being issued the weapon were told it was self - cleaning , which it was n't .
<en=10>As a result there was a problem with the weapon jamming .
<en=11>Once the troops started cleaning the weapon properly ( even with the dirtier powder ) the Vietnam era M - 16 turned out to be a good weapon for the purpose it was being used for .
<en=12>The screw - up was the kind of things you have happen when you have bean - counters ( and McNamara was nothing if not a bean - counter ) instead of soldiers in charge of the military .
<en=13>Today 's weapons do not have that kind of problem , and are much more reliable .
<en=14>1 ) modern m 16 is alright .
<en=15>Vietnam m 16 used to clog up and never work .
<en=16>2 ) All M 16's are either automatic or semi automatic .
<en=17>No one uses 3 burst .
<en=18>you play too much cod ;P
<en=19>modern m 16 is best
