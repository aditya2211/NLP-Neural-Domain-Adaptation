<en=1>I have a Nacho Libre question .?
<en=2>When nacho is driving to cure the influenza guy does he say to the man with the cow i like your blouse or I like your cow because my friend thinks he says I like your blouse , but that would n't make sense .
<en=3>I know it s in the wrong catagory , but still , I wrote this question for a reason , not for you to critisize me .
<en=4>Okay , FIRST , you have posted a question about an American movie , set in Mexico , in the Dining Out in Argentina category .
<en=5>Do you get what 's wrong with this picture ?
<en=6>No ... that 's all .
<en=7>No second .
<en=8>Nacho Libre is suppose to be inspired in Mexicans , not in Argentineans .
