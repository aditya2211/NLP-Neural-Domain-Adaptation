<en=1>Canadian student visa , can I used for other schools ?
<en=2>I applied to get a student visa to study in Canada , I received one that is valid until October of 2015 .
<en=3>Problem is , for some reason , the visa process took longer than it should , thus I missed school this semester ( visa was issued to me about 25 days after school started so I could n't attend ) , now I no longer want to go into that school ( because they only would accept me again on September of 2012 ) , I found a school that accepted me for may 2012 , can I use the same visa that was issued to me ?
<en=4>or do I need to reapply ?
<en=5>( in the visa itself , it does not mention anything about which school I m suppose to attend , and problem is , the embassy here in DC are not too nice and would never answer ANY questions .... ) any advice please ?
<en=6>Visas and Study Permits are administered by Citizenship and Immigration Canada , and any questions regarding applications should be directed to them .
