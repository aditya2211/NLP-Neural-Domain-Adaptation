<en=1>How can i make my Jack Dempsey reproduce ?
<en=2>i have a Mature male and female they are together a lot but never laid eggs as far as i know can anyone help me figure out how to make them mate
<en=3>He 's the issue , you are trying to " Make " them mate .
<en=4>This is like trying to Make 2 people get married .
<en=5>It does n't work .
<en=6>First you need a compatible pair .
<en=7>Sounds like your 2 at least tolerate each other , so there is hope there .
<en=8>Then the need to be mature , that is , old enough , and big enough to breed .
<en=9>This may be around 1 / 2 of their full adult size , probably 4 - 5 " for those guys .
<en=10>Then the environment .
<en=11>Large tank , no annoying tankmates , perfect water conditons and really good feeding .
<en=12>The difference is what they need to live , VS what 's ideal for them .
<en=13>Get that right , and they will mate when THEY are ready .
<en=14>You ca n't MAKE them mate , you can only encourage them .

<en=16>Jack Dempseys are not an easy cichlid to breed .
<en=17>Most of the time one is more interested in breeding than the other .
<en=18>Bredders take the one that in not very interested and put it alone in a breeeding tank for 3 - 5 days .
<en=19>The tank should have a hide space big enough for one fish , or a few of them , but at least 1 cave big enough for two fish to fit in .
<en=20>The p H should be 6.5 - 7 .
<en=21>Now feed the one in the breeding tank as much bloodworms , blackworms and / or earthworms as it can eat for 3 - 5 days .
<en=22>Then add the other mate .
<en=23>They may not respond right away and they may fight so ther smaller one can fit in one of hide spaces if it gets attacked .
<en=24>When the male s aggressive behavior stops , it is ready to spawn .
<en=25>The two lay their eggs inside the cave you made for them .
<en=26>Turn the water temp up to 82 degrees
