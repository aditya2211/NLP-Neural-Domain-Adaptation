<en=1>taking young cat with me for a week out of state ?
<en=2>good idea ?
<en=3>i have a 3 - 4 month old kitten and i live in forida .
<en=4>i am going to my grandma s in north carolina and we are going camping in a cabin in west virginia .
<en=5>My cat is a outside cat but she loves it inside .
<en=6>she is also good in a carrier .
<en=7>Should i bring her ?
<en=8>if so how quick will she adapt to a litter box inside ?
<en=9>thanks
<en=10>We took our cat Mitten camping .
<en=11>He loved it .
<en=12>But he was an inside / outside cat ( only one I owned - rest have been 100 0nside cats ) .
<en=13>He was trained to a harness / leash for outside time but he knew to use the litter pan inside .
<en=14>If your cat is not trained to use the litter pan , you may have a problem taking her .
<en=15>NO !
<en=16>changing its surroundings too often will stress it out and it will get depressed , mean , sick , or will not want to be around you .
