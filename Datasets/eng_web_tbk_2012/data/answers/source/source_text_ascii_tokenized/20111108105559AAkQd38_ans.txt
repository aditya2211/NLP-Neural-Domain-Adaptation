<en=5>when i watched werewolf in london ( great film ) that was the only time i saw the yorkshire moors .
<en=6>can anyone give me information about them ?
<en=7>They can be bleak and eerie , often very exposed , often covered with antiquities like bronze age burial mounds , stone circles and settlements -- until late in the bronze age they were rich farmlands , then a change in the climate caused the skies to cloud over and rain to wash the goodness from the soil .
<en=8>The people abandoned their farms and religious sites and the ground they stood on became moorland .
<en=9>They can also be very beautiful when the purple heather is out , and they are habitat to much wildlife and many species of wildflowers .
