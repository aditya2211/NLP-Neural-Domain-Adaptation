<en=1>what does it mean when a veiled chameleon egg is soft ?
<en=2>my female chameleon just laid eggs yesterday and today some of the eggs are soft when i mean soft i mean like not like ordinary chameleon eggs .
<en=3>They are probably infertile .
<en=4>If there is no male they are probably infertile !
<en=5>If you take a flash light and shine it through the eggs and you see nothing throw them away !
<en=6>If you do not they will start to rot !
<en=7>If she has no male to fertilize the eggs , the eggs will aways be infertile .
<en=8>if you do have a male but they are not in the same cage or breeding but you touch him then her she will smell his sent and probably lay eggs .
<en=9>Hope she stops laying eggs because she will get really skinny !
<en=10>If she continues !
<en=11>Hope this helps
