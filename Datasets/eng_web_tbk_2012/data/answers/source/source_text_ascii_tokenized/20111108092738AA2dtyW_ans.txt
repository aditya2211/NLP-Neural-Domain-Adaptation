<en=1>What cleaners should I use for dusting around my parakeet ?
<en=2>What cleaners can I use to dust around my budgie .
<en=3>Would pledge be ok ?
<en=4>If not , what is ?
<en=5>Your best bet would just be a swiffer duster -- they do n't require cleaner .
<en=6>If you must use a cleaner , pledge should be fine if the area that you keep your parakeet in is well ventilated .
<en=7>I have had parakeets for a VERY long time , and I use pledge .
<en=8>Just keep a window open for a while for fresh air to circulate .
<en=9>I agree w the answer from Nothing .
<en=10>Even a cotton cloth ( I like diapers ) that is barely damp w water will work fine .
<en=11>Swiffer or any type of micro-fiber cloth is excellent .
<en=12>I use Miracle Cloth , they 're fantastic , just do n't use fabric softener or dryer sheets when cleaning them , it ruins their " grabbing " ability .
