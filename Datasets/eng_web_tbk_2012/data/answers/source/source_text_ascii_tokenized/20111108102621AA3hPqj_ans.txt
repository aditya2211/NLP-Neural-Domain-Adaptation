<en=1>bearded dragon spikes ?
<en=2>bit of a stupid question but do the spikes / spines ( whatever you call them ) on their side and face area ever go hard .
<en=3>or are they just supposed to look like they are so nothing will try to eat them
<en=4>becca is right .
<en=5>i v owned beardies for ovr 3 yrs and i handle mine all the time .. they do nt go hard lik eneedle hard but they ar nt pillow soft .
<en=6>they use them to look prickly .. would you try to eat a cactus [ if u had no knife ] i know i would nt .
<en=7>they puff out to look bigger and badder and they can scratch you a lil if u r holding them to tight :)
<en=8>They re not really hard .
<en=9>Beardies are actually quite delicate .
<en=10>I 'm assuming it 's to scare off predators / like how they will puff up their neck spikes to make them look bigger to predators or enemies .
<en=11>they do nt hurt unless you r stupid enough to press on them .
<en=12>They just are there as an adaptation .
