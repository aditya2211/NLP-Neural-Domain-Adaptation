<en=1>How to start a new fish tank ?
<en=2>I 'm getting a 10 gallon for my betta tomorrow and I just want to know how to properly set it up .
<en=3>I 'm still a beginner .
<en=4>Any and all suggestions on what I need to do and buy will help .
<en=5>Thanks .
<en=6>When you get the tank make sure you wash the inside ( with plain water ) then you wash the gravel ( with only water too ) take out all the stuff that is floating on top .
<en=7>Add only silk plants as plastic ones may tear up ur betta s delicate fins .
<en=8>You add the water and put water conditioner into the water .
<en=9>Start up your filter ( sponge filters are the best for bettas ) and put in a heater and set it to anywhere between 78 - 82 .
<en=10>Wait about 2 weeks or 3 and test your water .
<en=11>If everything is looking good you may add you betta to its new home .
<en=12>Lights are optinal since fish need the light turn off at night anyways and an air pump is not nessasary since they get air from the surface .
<en=13>ask the people selling you the fish how you should set it up , they would know
<en=14>Add aquasafe with the water you put in it .
<en=15>Make sure the temperature is good .
<en=16>Do not put your fish tank close to the sun or algae grow in your tank .
<en=17>Everything else should be good .
<en=18>Make sure if you get new fish that they get along with one another .
