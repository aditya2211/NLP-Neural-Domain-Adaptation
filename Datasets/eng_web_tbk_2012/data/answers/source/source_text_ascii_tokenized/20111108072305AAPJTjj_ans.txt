<en=1>Canon sx40 or canon s100 ?
<en=2>Which one should i get ?
<en=3>It s prettty much the same $$$ , please advice !?????!!!!
<en=4>Go with the S100 .
<en=5>It 's more compact , ISO 6400 capability ( SX40 only 3200 ) , faster lens at f/2 and the SX40 only f / 2.7 .
<en=6>Both have full 1080 video with stereo recording , so that does n't matter .
<en=7>The S100 has a slightly larger screen and the new digic 5 processor .
