<en=3>Jeez , work on your spelling and punctuation .
<en=4>It makes a huge difference .
<en=5>No one 's going to hire you if you ca n't even spell , especially if you 're a high school graduate .
<en=6>Cover letters and resumes need to be perfect .
<en=7>No one 's going to take you seriously if they 're full of typos and whatnot .
<en=8>Sorry , I would put that application in the round file .
<en=9>Nope
