<en=1>which one out of these makes the best pet ?
<en=2>a degu , a rat , a mouse , a hamster or a guinea pig ?
<en=3>and why is the one a better pet ?
<en=4>Get a guinea pig .
<en=5>I have a hamster , and mice and rats like to escape .
<en=6>The Guinea pig is better because it s a lot larger than a hamster , rat , mouse , or degu .
<en=7>So if you lose him , he is easier to find , because smaller rodents just LOVE to escape from their cages .
<en=8>So my opinion is Guinea pigs .
<en=9>( plus they do nt stink that bad )
<en=10>Depends on what you want in a pet , to be honest .
<en=11>Also depends on the space you have , how much time you can handle the pet , how much money you can spend , etc .
<en=12>I 've had experience with all of those pets except Degus .
<en=13>My favorite would have to be the rat .
<en=14>They 're incredibly social , highly trainable , and very clean .
<en=15>Mine learned to " go to the bathroom " only in their cages and loved to ride on my shoulder or hang out in my hoodie pouch .
<en=16>The only downside is they should be kept in pairs or trios and require a pretty large habitat .
<en=17>That means expense , space , and they require weekly cage cleaning .
<en=18>My second favorite would have to be the Guinea Pig - not quite as social with people as rats ( at least mine was n't ) but more so than most hamsters or mice .
<en=19>Again , pairs or trios and pretty big living space .
<en=20>They , too , need weekly cage cleaning and can cost quite a bit .
<en=21>I could handle my mice , but they where skittish and preferred their cage .
<en=22>I 've never met a hamster that did n't bite me .
<en=23>Never had / handled a Degu .
<en=24>Get a guinea pig .
<en=25>We have two .
<en=26>They are social and like to be handled .
<en=27>You have to have two because they do n't do well alone .
<en=28>Make certain you get two females .
<en=29>Two males can fight and you definitely do n't want babies !!
<en=30>Guinea pigs ( also called cavies ) are gentle creatures and are awake during the day and sleep at night .
<en=31>They will whistle when they hear you as an encouragement for you to give them a treat like leaf lettuce .
<en=32>They love leaf or romaine lettuce and tomatos , celery , cucumbers , carrots .
<en=33>Do n't feed them broccoli , cauliflower , garlic , onions , head lettuce .... they are all too difficult for them to digest .
<en=34>Also they ca n't eat potatos , they are toxic for them .
<en=35>If you keep the cage clean they do n't smell and you can buy spray on cleaser for them , just massage it into their coat and groom them .
