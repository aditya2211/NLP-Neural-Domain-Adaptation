I would strongly suggest "The Breakfast Club" in Chicago.  You can definately plan on a great meal with reasonable prices.   Don't be in a hurry though.  Just relax and enjoy.  They have fabulous French toast too.

The Breakfast Club & Grill is conveniently located just two blocks off the Kennedy Expressway. There is always plenty of parking on the street or in our private lot. If you'd rather dine at home, simply call in your order with our take-out service. Plenty of parking on the weekends..during the week please park in the little lot across the street.

Directions from the Kennedy: Take the Ogden Exit off the Kennedy. Go three lights down and take a right onto Ogden. Continue two blocks to Hubbard and take another right. We're at the corner of Hubbard and Noble.

Unless you plan on being late for the bridal shower you might want to post this again in the L.A. section.
