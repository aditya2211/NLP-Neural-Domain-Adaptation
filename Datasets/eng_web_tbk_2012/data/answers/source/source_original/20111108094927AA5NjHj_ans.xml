I would say it really depends on your riding ability, what disciplines you are interested in doing, or plan on doing, etc. But I would go for the base number of 15hh. It's "tall" being it's bigger than a pony, but it's on the small end for a horse. I got my horse when I was 12 and I was already 5'9-5'10, thankfully I stopped growing when I hit 5'11" but my horse is about 16.2 or 16.3hh, TB.
So don't be afraid to get something a little bigger than "perfect" just in case you hit a growth spurt. A taller horse doesn't always mean a horse you can't handle. Keep that in mind. Also keep in mind whether you want to be able to jump up from the ground, if you even need to, etc. You just want to be sure you can groom and saddle sufficiently and the horse itself is calm enough so that whatever size it is, you can handle it.

If you Don't want to grow out of it quickly get a 14'2 .. Anything smaller you will grow out, anything bigger will be too big and difficult to control and manage, especially when riding. Hope I helped :)
