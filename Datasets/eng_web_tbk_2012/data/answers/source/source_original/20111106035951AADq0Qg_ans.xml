I always thought Mayko or Meiko is a Japanese name. The Canadian Regenesis actress Mayko Nguyen has Japanese connection or is it her fake name?
Right, I couldn't find any proven source for that. And her last name, Nguyen is a typical Vietnamese family name...anyone?

Certainly, Nguyen is the one of first names of many people in Vietnam, only in Vietnam. Mayko is relating to the Japanese. In Vietnam, when a baby was born, they must be named "first name" according to that of their fathers. It's principle except a number of cases, for example, the babies are orphans or not to have father.
E.g. 
Full name of the father is: "Nguyen Thanh Luan" ===> Full name of the son/daughter certainly is " Nguyen..........", for instance, "Nguyen Thi Thuy Lan". But if the babies were born in American so they would named in other way but still remain "First name" in order to recall about their origination.
