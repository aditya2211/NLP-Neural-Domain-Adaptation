Are the hotels back up and running? Are there still aftershocks? Planning on going to North and South Island. Is it safe to go to Rotarua, since the earthquakes?

Rotorua is fine. I'm assuming this was in reference to the January earthquake, don't worry, it was very deep, so nothing was effected :)

As for Christchurch, yes the aftershocks are still happening, but these are fairly small - you can feel them, but the don't do any damage. Since lots of people are still living there, then it must be fine to visit. However the CBD is closed of to the public as a lot of it is still rubble and stuff and hasn't been cleared away yet. I'm sure that you can find some hotels that are running in the christchurch area, but if not then there would be some in close by towns. Despite the aftershocks I would recommend going to Christchurch, just for the experience and then you can see first hand how things get effected by earthquakes.

Have fun in New Zealand!! 

(ps. I'm assuming you'll stop off in Wellington, and since its summer, may I recommend kaffee eis ice creams and gelatos? Just recently discovered them last time I was down there, they're very nice) www.kaffeeeis.co.nz

Loads of places have geographical hazards, if you are constantly paranoid, you'll never get anywhere without a sense of adventure. In case of an earthquake, stay under a sturdy table and don't go outside as possible debris will fall.
