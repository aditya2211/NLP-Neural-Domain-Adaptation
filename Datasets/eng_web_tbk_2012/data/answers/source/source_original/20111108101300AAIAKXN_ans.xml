I'll be in Okinawa for about a week so I was wondering what are some fun things I could do? I'm a 20 year old female travelling by myself so it could be anything. Besides the obvious tourist spots which I already have planned for. How is the night life in Naha? Are there any good venues that showcase underground bands, or just a venue at all? It doesn't have to be underground it could be any type of music. 
Thanks

The best thing you can do in Okinawa is to go to a beach. Otherwise, you can do what you can do in other parts or Japan, like shopping, eating, etc.

Or you can visit temples or shrines in Okinawa.

Well first you can try speaking Japanese.
Go to a sumo tournament.
Eat at a conveyor-belt sushi restaurant.
Climb Mount Fuji.

Okinawa is quite different from the rest of Japan, although of course there are similarities.

The main thing people do there is go to the beach.  There's the market in Naha, which is great.  You can find all sorts of fresh food and get a really delicious, fresh sashimi/sushi lunch upstairs.  Try the local sake too if you can.  It's a special kind.

I'm not sure that there's much nightlife in Naha.  It's more of a place to go to enjoy the weather, the sea, etc.  You might have to make your own nightlife by finding an izakaya (pub) somewhere.

Your best bet would probably be to get a copy of the Lonely Planet Japan book and read the chapter on Okinawa.  Naha's not a very big city.
