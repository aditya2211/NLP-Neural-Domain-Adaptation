As far ask I’m aware our most unique custom would be the “Country Wake”. In all my travels I’ve never seen anything like it and am often met with an odd look when I explain them to foreigners. After a person dies, their remains are “waked ” in their home for roughly 2-3days. In this time visitors will come to the house, pay their respects to the desisted and their family and have a couple of cups of tea with a  sandwich or a bun. The wake also included the night sit were friends and family sit up through the night with the remains. 

Wakes are common both north and south of the boarder with Protestants and Catholics alike. But only really in the countryside.

The only notable difference I have noticed is that in the south of Ireland one night of the wake is often held in the chapel the night before the funeral, this tradition started after the civil war.



Another unique custom (and a dying one at that) is the Pioneers. The Pioneers was an organization started at the end of the 19th century which pushed and supported the ideal of temperance (abstaining from alcohol), in an attempt to deal with the massive issue of alcoholism  that Ireland was gripped by. Pioneers take a pledge to remain tee-total and at the hight of the organization popularity, had an estimated two million members even filling Croke Park on the 25th anniversary. I my self am one but appreciate that the organization is unlikely to make into the 22nd century.



The Orange Order and the 12th of July Marches would be argued by some not to be an Irish custom but unarguable ticks every criteria to be considered one. The marches on the 12th of July are only really attended by protestants in the Ulster but in spite of the are the largest attended paraded in Ireland.
