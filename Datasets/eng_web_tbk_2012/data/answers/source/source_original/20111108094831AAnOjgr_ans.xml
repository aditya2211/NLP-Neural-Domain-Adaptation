I love how it really depends on how good a horse your horse really is, not how talented he is. If you took some Olympic-level horses on a trail ride, they just couldn't do it. They would be too scared and spooky. It doesn't matter how graceful your horse is, or how high he can jump, or how well he does a sliding stop. What matters is how well trained he is, and how good your bond it. That is another reason why I like competitive trail riding also. Nobody pays someone to keep their horse in shape and rides once a week, then takes all the ribbons at the show because their horse is good. YOU have to spend the time training. And I have not met one stuck-up trail rider!  Those are just a few reasons why I love trail riding, competitive or not.

Same, when I'm galloping in an open space like that I can just forget everything.

Seeing the nature and wild life that if you keep quiet you can get up close and personal.  I have had several close encounters with both foxes and wild deer.  Also woodpeckers were pecking in the trees and I just sat and watched.  Fascinating.
