Personally, I don't find a travel agent to be of value to me as I am willing to put in the time doing research on the internet. I have not had good experience with travel agents. They don't seem to know anything but the hype they are told and the packages they have available to them.
The one time I actually booked through a travel agent I did not get all of the amenities I had paid for.
The few times I have consulted with a travel agent I was able to find the same for less on my own, and more options than what they were selling. So now I do not bother with them at all.
