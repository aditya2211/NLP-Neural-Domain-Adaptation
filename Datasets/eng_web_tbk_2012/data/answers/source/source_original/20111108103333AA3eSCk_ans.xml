In short Yes. However not in all cases. If your (US) provider has a deal with a canadian wireless company, you texts and calls will go through. They will, however, cost a bunch. The only way to know for sure is to call 611, or your cell phone help line, and ask. The phones and networks are compatible, so the only reason it wouldn't work would be if you have, say, a cheap cell phone company..

Ye$ you can Text in CANADA to the U$ on a U$ number. Thi$ $ervice will co$t. It varie$ company to company. You may want to get a temporary phone for your trip to Canada. Is there any other way to communicate or do your friends only understand text. Email usually free if you use a WiFi connection. $ometime$ it is hard to explain that you are making an INTERNATIONAL call and all of the phone companie$ involved what $ome of your money. Hope you unde$tood the me$$age I do have an "S" key on my computer.
