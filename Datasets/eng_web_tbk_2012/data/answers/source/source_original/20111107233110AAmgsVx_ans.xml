Is Fujairah a nice place to live in?
</Subject>
<Content>
My family and I are planning to shift to Fujairah in a couple of years. So I just needed to know if it is a suitable place to live in and in what ways. Also that, I heard in the next few years Fujairah would be as good as Dubai, is it true? I'd be happy if someone helps, especially someone who has been to Fujairah or lives there. :)

I LIVE THERE! ... Ive been living in Fujairah my entire life and I must say that it is developing in a good way. I think 2012 is going to be a great year for Fujairah as we have ALOT of projects to be done by 2012. Things to do in Fujairah.. Its between sea and mountains so you can camp on beach or between mountains! ... Fishing, Jet skies, snorkeling, diving are some of the things you can do for fun. And now they are finishing a road between Fujairah and Dubai in 45 minutes only! So, no it is not as good as Dubai, but its quieter and more peaceful, and you can still go to Dubai in 45 mins. 

please let me know if you need anything else

Visited Fujairah when in Dubai.  Nothing like Dubai, and never will be!  
Don't know the economics of Fujairah but Dubai is basically bankrupt so you wouldn't want to end up like them! 
Unless you have a particular skill they need - and firm job offer before going - I would think twice about it!
