Limerick's a great student city, there's loads on, you'll be spoilt for choice. In fact, you probably won't ever want to leave.

Orla got it in one. Although there is 'bad press' directing at AREA'S of limerick, but nowhere near the university. Limerick is such a full city, shopping, night life, career choices, social choices, I came here about 12 years ago for college.....and Orla got it spot on, I haven't left, nor would I. Its now my home.
