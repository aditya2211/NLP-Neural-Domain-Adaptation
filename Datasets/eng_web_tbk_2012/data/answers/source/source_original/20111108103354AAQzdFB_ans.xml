CHILL OUT!  Firstly, your hammie was not stressed out, he wanted attention. Secondly, that is normal behavior as they use the wheels in the night. Thirdly, just put your hand in his cge ans leave it their. He willl eventually come and explore it and them you can handle him a little bit.


Hope I helped!

Give him time. You only got him yesterday. He's probably still scared and unsure. Once he has properly settled down, got use to the new smells and noises he will be fine. Once he is more comfy with his surroundings, then you can start handling him and getting to know each other more. But just give him time for now.
