Can rabbits and chickens live together?
</Subject>
<Content>
I am thinking about getting a rabbit as a pet, but my parents said that it has to stay outside. We also own two chickens that are kept in a run behind out garage/barn thing. There is already a little dog house that I would turn into a little rabbit hutch being kept back there and I was thinking about keeping the rabbit in the run with the chickens, but keeping the chickens in the coop and the rabbit in the hutch at night. However, in the day time would it be okay for the rabbit to hop around along with the chickens? We feed the chickens scraps of veggies and fruits throughout the day, but it's nothing that a rabbit wouldn't be able to digest just fine. So, can rabbits and chickens live together as long as they have separate places for their food and water? (The rabbit hutch would have an opening only big enough for the rabbit, the chickens would not be able to get to the rabbit food) Also, is it okay if the rabbit occasionally sneaks a few bites of chicken feed? My last rabbit did that a few times, and he was fine...I just wanna make sure :) Thank!

Yes,but be sure that your chickens are all hens(I mean not roosters),Roosters may attack rabbits or anything they see moving,so be aware of that,hens are friendly with almost all kinds of pets! From my experience Hens(Not roosters) are very friendly with duck,Guinea pigs,kittens,cows,Rabbits,etc.

Be sure not to feed your rabbits non-veg items! You said they live in different cages and they are free in day,so no problem,don't put both of them in one cage because rabbits bedding is different than that of hens,wet bedding can cause diseases in them! So,don't put both of them in one cage.

Good luck!

yea i guess but rabbits a easily escape a pen or another rabbit could get in there and that rabbit could be the opposite gender. So be very careful and some feeds could be toxic to rabbits and safe for chickens.Rabbits do burrow also so don't be surprised if chicken are falling into holes. rabbits are delicate and can get diseases so watch out for that.
