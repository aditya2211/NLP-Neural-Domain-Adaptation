Does your train pass Asansol when starting from Howrah? If yes, you don't need to change it because you board later.
If no, you'll have to go to one of the train stations. In Calcutta there is a Foreigner's reservation office where they speak English very well. I don't remember near which station it is though. They can help you and it is close to a train station in Calcutta so check a few big ones? Even if you don't find the foreigner's office you'll be fine in the normal Reservation Office of any big train station. This is where you can get AND change express train tickets.

well if your desired boarding station comes after more than 2 or 3 halts of the actual boarding point, then the TC will cancel you ticket and allot the seat to others.
so better inquire in railway office
