Crayola Air- Dry Clay?
</Subject>
<Content>
Ok. So I have a VERY long list of people I want to make Xmas gifts for and one of them is my best friend. She loves giraffes and homemade things! I am very artistic so I decided I was going to make her a giraffe sculpture. I don't have much money so I bought Crayola Air-Dry Clay. I have sculpted the giraffe laying down.

The key is...I have a few problems:

1. I tested it out by making a figure boat 
And after 4 days when it dried it was very fragile! (like VERY not in a good way) 
Is there any way to strengthen it? 
2. What kind of paint do I use to paint the giraffe?

3. Is there any cheap way to give it a shine like I made it in a kiln?

air dry clay works on armatures , the clay has a minor shrink percent, so you can leave the wire armature inside, paint with acrylic paint
