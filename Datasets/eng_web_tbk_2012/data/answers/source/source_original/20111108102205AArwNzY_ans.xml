I'm going on a vacation to the Philippines in May 2012, and I'm starting from Raleigh, NC (RDU Airport). Which airlines should I look into and when should I buy my ticket?

The sooner the better but I'd probably wait until after the holidays.  Use Travelocity or Expedia and see what you come up with.  My friend goes to the Phils every 6 months or so and she has found that Korean Air has had the cheapest fares lately.  Raleigh to Chicago, Chicago to Seoul and then Seoul to Manila.  Compare compare compare - that's the key to getting the best deal.

On my last 6 trips here from the states I used "Fly genesis" based in Seattle, Wa. They gave the best service & rates I could find.
