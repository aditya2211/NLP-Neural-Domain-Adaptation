no pet is really easy to take care of. they all need love and attn , food, proper surroundings etc.
the easiest thing would be a fish - but u need to clean the tank weekly, feed it the right amt, etc etc x

Having a pet isn't easy. You should treat all pets like children. They require a lot of attention or they get fussy and tear stuff up. 

If you want easy then go with a gold fish or hamster.

I would go with a small rodent such as a mouse, rat, hamster or gerbil if you want something you can handle and hold.
Fish are probably the easiest to take care of though.
