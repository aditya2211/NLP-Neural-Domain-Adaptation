Ugh my dad is so stupid... he just doesn't understand anything! I have 5 sisters and so including my mom... he is the only guy in a house of six females. Now I'm the youngest and I just got my period so now we all have ours and he thinks it's a good thing? He's always like "ohh you must be so happy to finally have yours, I wish I had mine!" and he isn't even joking. I think just living in a house with so many girls is making him go crazy?

Don't blame him please, he feels lonely and wants to show his attention to all of you to look after you, please forgive and sympathy if he miss something. I am sorry for him, he is a good dad
