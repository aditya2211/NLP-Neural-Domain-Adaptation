No one employs people from Hartpury because of what they received on work experience.

Merrist Wood (I'm there on a NVQ equine course) do HND in equine management.

Your best bet is to look on UCAS and do a course search.

Merrist Wood in Woking in Surrey.
Moreton Morrell in Coventry, Warwickshire
Hartpury College (I think that is the name, but if you type it in it should come up with an alternative suggestion), in Gloucestershire.

Go onto the UCAS website, go onto course search and search for the courses you want to do. 

They'll give you a comprehensive list of all the universities that do the courses you want, plus all the information you need to apply.
