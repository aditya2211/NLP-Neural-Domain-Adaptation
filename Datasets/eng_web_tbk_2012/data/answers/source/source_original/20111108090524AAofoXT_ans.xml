How much should I be looking at for horse transportation?
</Subject>
<Content>
I need one horse transported to shows throughout the 2012 show season, and the location is about 3 hours away from where I live. The place where I'm boarding is not likely to want to take me this far, and I do not have any ways of hauling him myself. 
So I want to hire someone (or multiple people) to transport me to these shows.
If they ask how much I'm willing to pay, what is a good price range?
I saw a site that charges $0.70 per mile. Is that reasonable?

Impossible to say, but I guess you would have to work out fuel consumption for the particular vehicle that they are using and pay a proportion of that, and some on top for the driver's time and effort, unless you are able to share transport with another or more, that would keep the costs down.

Remember that you get what you pay for.  Three hours isn't far, but you are doing multiple shows.  Some people are willing to take your horse, but they really have old trailers that are not the safest in the world.  Rusted, torn corners in the stalls, unhealthy air, straight load instead of slant load can all make travelling hard, if not downright dangerous, on  your horse.  

I had my horse transported from CA to WA and he came on this big, open stock trailer.  He was dehydrated when he got there and lost weight.  Since then, I now use a professional horse hauling service with people who ride with my horse to keep an eye on him, stop every few hours for water, and their trailers all have super smooth suspension.  All horses I've had delivered to me since then are happy and healthy when they arrive.

I would call Bob Hubbard Transport and get a quote.  Even though you may not want to use them, it will give you some idea of what it might cost and what is fair.  See link below.

Make sure the trailer service you use is bonded/insured and knows something about first aid.
