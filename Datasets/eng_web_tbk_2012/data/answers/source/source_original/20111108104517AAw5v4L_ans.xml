I was thinking cichlids? Possibly a freshwater tank with a ton of different species in there. I've never kept cichlids though. I know saltwater is a possibility, can you give me a possible stocking option for that too? I'll choose the one that sounds the best after looking into all the fish :)

Here is the stocking for my 150 gallon tank  i upgraded it to 200 at the weekend because of the clownloach A 200 gallon with 6 pairs of Breeding Angel fish fire mouth honey Gouramis 5 8 inch clownloach a Krib and 5 1 inch clown loach with 16 cory cats 5 Australian Rainbows 
If you took out the clown loach it would make a nice 150 gallon tank.
