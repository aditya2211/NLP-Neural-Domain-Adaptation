I searched all over the internet, but I could not find one place in Tampa Bay that sells morcillas, also known as blood pudding, black pudding and blood sausages. I learned that morcillas are basically impossible to find all across the North American region. But I did find this website, www.igourmet.com, where they sell all types of sausages, including blood sausages! So follow the link at the bottom and buy some blood sausages.
