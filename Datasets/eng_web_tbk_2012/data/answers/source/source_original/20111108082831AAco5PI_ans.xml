French dating etiquette?
</Subject>
<Content>
I would really love to hear what the French or those who had dated the French to say something about this. 

I'm in my 20's and currently studying in France. Coming from an anglo-saxon country my version of dating is 'getting the number, asking her out, etc..' 

However, I've read on the internet that the French dating etiquette is totally different. For them, dating would normally be meeting in groups or parties, then pairing off. In addition, from my understanding one-on-one dates is something that comes much later and not 'straight-away' like us anglo-saxons.

They are also very secretive about being in a relationship. They only 'go out in the open' once they have reached a certain level of seriousness.

Is it true?

I have told a French girl I liked her, and she accepted. She is friendly when we see each other on campus. She is also nicer when we are both alone. However, when we are at parties or when they are people around she seems to ignore me. She also seems to hate it whenever I ask her out on a date, to the point she said stop!

My mind thinks she has no interest in me and just stringing me along. But the articles I read seemed to say the contrary. 

Have I just fallen victim in a cultural trap?

What you have read in the internet is fairly accurate  but of course it does not fit all scenarios. 
You are not French for a start, so the "rules" or "customs" may not apply to you when it comes to entering into a relationship between people from different backgrounds.
From what you say the messages given by this girl are quite clear. She is not stringing you along since she is actually discouraging you and is honest enough to tell you to stop asking her out . She is just being friendly in public because she does not want to offend you and she treats you like any other friend. You said you liked her and she accepted it as a truth and perhaps as a compliment, but it does not mean she fancies you  or wants to pair off with you. At parties she does not want to be considered in any way attached to you, which is consistent.
Take the messages for what they are: she has no objection in you being pals at uni, but she does not want to take matters further. "Non!" means "non", not "I might consider it, and I will keep you attached to my apron strings  just in case."

Christiane gave you a good answer. You have fallen in a cultural misunderstanding. What I have to add is that it is normal in France to have mixed gender groups of friends, there's nothing unusual in boys and girls being only friends, which is obviously what this girl wants from you. She probably finds your company pleasing as a friend but you are not her choice a a boyfriend and she is trying to keep it on a friendship level, and trying to make you understand that she doesn't want to go further. If she is nicer when you are alone I'd say it is because in public view she is making sure that people do not think that you might be her boyfriend. 
 
You do find the 'get the number hop in bed with her' but be aware that they usually have a reputation as sluts. Unfair for the girl as boys don't have that kind of handicap, but that's the way our own rules work.

Should have done research before you left. Why not just take your chances and do it your way?
