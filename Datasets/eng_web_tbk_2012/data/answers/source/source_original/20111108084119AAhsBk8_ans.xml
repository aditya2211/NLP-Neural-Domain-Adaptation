My myTouch 4G crashes with most custom ROMs I install. Can that be fixed?

I really like the MIUI, but a process crashes repeatedly about every 3 seconds. And I can't even load the newest version of Cyanogen Mod.

not by the company... as you voided your warrenty by installing custom roms

you are best to either recover to the standard ROM, or find one that doesn't crash.

cynangon mod should work.  Have you tried using clockwork recovery?  Get the older version of Cynagon mod.  Also you could use a stable rom like bugless beast and baked snake.  Those roms focus on speed and stability.  Or you could just use a home screen launcher replacement.  I would recommend go launcher or adw launcher.  They are both excellent and speed up the phone quite a bit.  As a mytouch 4g owner I know the phone is pretty fast and their is no point installing a rom.

Hope you read through this.
