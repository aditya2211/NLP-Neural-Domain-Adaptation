I am a 20 something gay black male and I am looking for suggestions on neighborhoods close to the downtown Toronto area. Im moving from South Carolina so this will already be a huge culture shock. Any suggestions?

Being gay and living in Toronto is just fine. You may consider the Gay Village on Church Street, right downtown. It is full of gay friendly "everything". But, you could live where ever you fancy takes you. For obvious reasons, knowing how extremely difficult it is to drive a car in the city, you should probably try to be near the subway system.

But, can you immigrate? Being an American guarantees you no favours when it come to going to Canada.

Start your process here, if you haven't already. (Marrying a Canadian is not enough - that doesn't count for at least two years.)

A normal processing time, unless you have an advanced degree or a "specified" skill is from 3 - 5 years. Coming to stay, and overstay your three months visit will lead to immediate expulsion and a lifetime ban to immigrate to Canada - NOT GOOD.

Lets be clear about this...........Just 'wanting to come to Canada " is NOT enough.

You MUST apply, to become a Immigrant, and WAIT to be approved, by the Canadian Government.

YOUR education ( the more the better ) and your past work history, combined with a CLEAN FBI and State Police record, and a satisfactory financial history ( no bankruptcies or large outstanding debts in the USA ) are all taken into consideration. It is a competition, and YOU will be competing with hundreds of thousands of others, from all over the world, for a place in the line up.

IF you have NOT begun the Application process's NOW< you are about 2 to 3 years away from being approved by Immigration Canada. So don't pack your bags ,yet.

Whatever you do ...............DO NOT try to come here with out legal permission. You will not be able to seek work or take a job, in Canada, with out having to show your Immigration  VISA and  Canadian Social Insurance  Number card to any potential employer. Being an American and from the "south " you will be noticed as soon as you speak out loud

. Do it properly, and legally, and you will be OK.
