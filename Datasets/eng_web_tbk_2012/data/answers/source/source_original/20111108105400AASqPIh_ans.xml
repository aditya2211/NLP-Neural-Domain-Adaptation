Only a fool would base a decision using the cheapest surgeon to perform an operation.  Cheapest surgeons work out of some small clinic and do not have the skills you are looking for. .  Do you really want to put your faith in some clinic doctor.  I know I wouldn't.  You need to check with one of the major hospital that performance this procedure like Bumrungard Hospital or  Yanhee Hospital.

Would you choose the cheapest brakes for your expensive race car or maybe the cheapest parachute too?

Sometimes the "cheap" comes expensive!   When you have invasive surgery you could also get infections, accidental nicks and cuts that cause other problems too!   If they screw up you could be in worse shape than you are now!

Bumrungrad Hospital does some good work but all hospitals do have their problems from time to time.  Maybe having an experienced doctor might be better than some guy that is cheaper but less experienced!
