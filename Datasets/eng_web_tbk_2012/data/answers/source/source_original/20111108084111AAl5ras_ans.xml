I have a splitter/filter between my ADSL and ph line?

I have 2 phones running on the same line and the ADSL which is connected to one of the phones and the filter, I'm still getting a buzzing noise even when I have disconnected the other phone without one. Why is it stil doing this even though I don't have the other phone connected? Woud it be better if I got another filter and connected the other phone as well?

turn the modem off and see if the sound is still there... could be static on the line... if the sound is still there with the modem off then the problem is NOT the DSL....
if the trouble goes away with the modem off, then make sure that EVERYTHING EXCEPT the modem is filtered, this would include the alarm system, fax machine, satellite boxes, phones, etc... 

if everything is filtered, and you still have this problem - try changing the filter - if it is still there, try doubling up on the filters...

You need either a filter for each device except the DSL modem, or a whole home filter which filters all the jacks, except the one which the DSL modem connects.
