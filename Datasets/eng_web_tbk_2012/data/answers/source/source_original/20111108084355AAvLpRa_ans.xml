Wii U has been announced as well as the PS4 however the PS4 is only in development while the Wii U should be out next year. Microsoft has not announced there new console yet though it is believed to be in the works.

No matter when you buy you will get a newer version. I feel X-BOX is a very smooth system i own it like 3 years, its very compatible to previous versions and mostly important i was very comfortable with the User Interface and the JOYSTICK....coz you dont wana hold a joystick that gives you discomfort. XBOX Joys are soo comfyy.....Performance - You get the same in all, just get a good TV.

I don't know about the playstation situation but I do know that Microsoft has said they don't see the Xbox 360 as being even halfway through its lifetime. Since they released kinect this was kind of their way of releasing a new Xbox so they don't plan on making another one for a while. I do know they have already announced a new wii though and I don't know what Sony has said about playstation but again, if you get an Xbox (which I personally think is the best anyways) you should be set for a while.
