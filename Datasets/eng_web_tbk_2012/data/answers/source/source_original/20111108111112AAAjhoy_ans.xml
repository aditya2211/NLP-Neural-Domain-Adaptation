VERY CONCERNED!!! plz bring your dog to the vet ASAP!!! esp if not eating - if it had only happened once and could get him to eat right away - it could have been you missed his meal time and he needed to eat - since it sounds like it has happened several times over two days - then he may have gotten int to something that needs to be attended to RIGHT AWAY!!! or has acquired some type of disease and that too needs to be attended to...
