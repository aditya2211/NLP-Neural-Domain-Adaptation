Cheap restraunts close to Orchestra Hall in Chicago?

For a field trip with my orchestra, we are going to the Chicago Symphony Orchestra. Before that, we are turned loose to get dinner. Being a suburban teenager, I don't really know where is cheap, safe, and close to orchestra hall (220 South Michigan Ave.) Does anyone have any ideas for restaurants within walking distance where I can't get lost?

I don't know. Maybe if you post the question again, someone will give you a good answer.
