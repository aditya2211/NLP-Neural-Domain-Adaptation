They are probably infertile. If there is no male they are probably infertile! If you take a flash light and shine it through the eggs and you see nothing throw them away! If you do not they will start to rot! If she has no male to fertilize the eggs, the eggs will aways be infertile. if you do have a male but they are not in the same cage or breeding but you touch him then her she will smell his sent and probably lay eggs. Hope she stops laying eggs because she will get really skinny! If she continues! Hope this helps
