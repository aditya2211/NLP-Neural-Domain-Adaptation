i have a 3-4 month old kitten and i live in forida. i am going to my grandmas in north carolina and we are going camping in a cabin in west virginia. My cat is a outside cat but she loves it inside. she is also good in a carrier. Should i bring her? if so how quick will she adapt to a litter box inside?

We took our cat Mitten camping.  He loved it.  But he was an inside/outside cat (only one I owned - rest have been 100  0nside cats).  He was trained to a harness/leash for outside time but he knew to use the litter pan inside.

If your cat is not trained to use the litter pan, you may have a problem taking her.

NO! changing its surroundings too often will stress it out and it will get depressed, mean, sick, or will not want to be around you.
