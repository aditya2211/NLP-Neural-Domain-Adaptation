May seem a little silly, but, taking a long ride on the Metra system or the "L" system is a great way to see the city and sites without spending a fortune.    Or how about visiting the Chicago Botanical Gardens and see the change of colors and enjoy the air, They also have many inside exhibits you might enjoy, food is pretty good to.

Bike ride in the park, followed by coffee.

You are busy, you don't have to sit face to face to try
to make convo, it's short, so if things go great, you can
extend, and if you want to end it, you just say bye,
gotta go.
