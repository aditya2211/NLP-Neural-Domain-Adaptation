Yes obviously the USB is region free which means you can use it anywhere. And every computer manufactured in both Ireland & the UK are Region 2 aka PAL. There won't be a difference since mobile broadband is supposed to be digital. But word of advice if you're get your girlfriend a laptop make sure its a good brand a not something like DELL, Acer, Asus, eMachines etc. just a heads up.
