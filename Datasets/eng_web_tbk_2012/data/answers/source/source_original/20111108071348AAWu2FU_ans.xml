Ive been dating a man from brittany france for a couple of months now. He's been away for a week and I was thinking of waiting for him in his apartment wearing only his dress shirt. Its still a fairly new relationship and we havent had sex yet so its kind of a big deal. I just dont want to freak him out or make him feel uncomfortable. Is it ok for a woman in french culture to make the first move? What do french men find sexy?

French women are the ones to say yes, the way we say it is not usually as straigthforward as you propose to do. Why not wait for him in a sexy dress with lunch or dinner, or a light snack at his house. And you take it up from there. Just make sure that it is a light meal with little alcohol.
