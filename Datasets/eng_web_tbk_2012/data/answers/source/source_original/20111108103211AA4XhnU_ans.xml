</Subject>
<Content>
I'm getting a 10 gallon for my betta tomorrow and I just want to know how to properly set it up.
I'm still a beginner.
Any and all suggestions on what I need to do and buy will help. Thanks.

When you get the tank make sure you wash the inside (with plain water) then you wash the gravel (with only water too) take out all the stuff that is floating on top. Add only silk plants as plastic ones may tear up ur bettas delicate fins. You add the water and put water conditioner into the water. Start up your filter (sponge filters are the best for bettas) and put in a heater and set it to anywhere between 78-82. Wait about 2 weeks or 3 and test your water. If everything is looking good you may add you betta to its new home. 

Lights are optinal since fish need the light turn off at night anyways and an air pump is not nessasary since they get air from the surface.

Add aquasafe with the water you put in it. Make sure the temperature is good. Do not put your fish tank close to the sun or algae grow in your tank. Everything else should be good. Make sure if you get new fish that they get along with one another.
