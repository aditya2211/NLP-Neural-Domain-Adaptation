When nacho is driving to cure the influenza guy does he say to the man with the cow i like your blouse or I like your cow because my friend thinks he says I like your blouse, but that wouldn't make sense.
I know its in the wrong catagory, but still, I wrote this question for a reason, not for you to critisize me.

Do you get what's wrong with this picture? 

No...that's all.  No second.

Nacho Libre is suppose to be inspired in Mexicans, not in Argentineans.
