Does a pacman absolutely need a uv lamp?

I assume you are talking about a pacman frog. No, technically they do not need a UVB light; they are nocturnal. However, it certainly wouldn't hurt if you wanted to provide one. 

A pacman frog will need a heat source that creates a basking temp in the upper 80's F for at least 10 - 12 hours a day. 

don't forget to use a calcium supplement twice a week; captive reptiles are prone to calcium deficiency.
