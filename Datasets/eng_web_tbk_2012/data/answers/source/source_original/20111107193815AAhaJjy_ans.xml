Question about the sinking of the Titanic?
</Subject>
<Content>
After the sinking of the Titanic in 1912, was there a law made so that ships would carry enough lifeboats to save everybody on a ship if it was sinking? If yes, was Canada involved in this act/law?
Sorry, I'm just very nervous after watching the movie.

SOLAS (Safety Of Life At Sea), which is an international maritime treaty, came about in response to the tragedy of the Titanic.

Today, it is the primary safety law affecting virtually all ships, regardless of country of registration. If you ever go on a cruise ship, you will be required to attend a SOLAS muster drill (lifeboat drill) within 24 hours of sailing. Most ships perform this drill before even leaving the dock.

SOLAS covers just about every aspect of safety at sea, including minimum safety equipment, practices, and standards, lifeboats, navigation practices, fire protection, and so on. We are much safer today on board ship due to SOLAS, and I suppose if any good came out of the Titanic tragedy, the adoption of SOLAS is probably it.

Edit: Also I forgot to mention earlier, most (if not all) cruise ships also practice lifeboat drills weekly, and it is not uncommon to see them to actually launch the lifeboats into the water as part of their drill when you are in port.   This not only ensures the lifeboats are operational and will work if needed, but makes the crew proficient at launching them.

Don't worry. When was the last time you heard about a ship sinking? 100 years ago?
