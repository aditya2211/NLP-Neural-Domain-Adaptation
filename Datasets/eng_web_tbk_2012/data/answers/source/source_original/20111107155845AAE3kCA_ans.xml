The thing about  The Script is they do not sound that Irish, I was surprised to hear they were from Dublin. 

Well if you are interested, I suggest you have a look at General Fiasco, Two Door Cinema Club and Wallis Bird.

I think you will be pleased.

And there's nothing distinctly Irish about them. You'd find similar bands to them that are from the UK and US.
