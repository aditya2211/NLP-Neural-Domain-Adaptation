</Subject>
<Content>
okay.... I have a dog and my mother is really really terrified of hamsters. Well last night while I was sleeping, my hamster escaped from his cage. He is in my room, but there are so many things inside there, I dunno what to do. I have lots of containers in there. Anybody give me ideas like a trap or something?

Find him before he finds the dog food. 
I'm not kidding , I once lost a hamster in my house 3 months later I walk down in the basement and it  was as big as a rat. It had been eating dog food the whole time. It was huge and scared the crap out of me.

Make sure he isn't trapped somewhere & put a bowl of food out. He will come and eat
