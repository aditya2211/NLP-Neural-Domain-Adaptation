I want to take a cruise around the world. I mean literally around the world if possible. First of if i went alone on a regular cabin how much would you estimate it would be just a guess.Second is there any way to sort of customize the places you wanna go to? Like you can pick the destinations? But if not just say no but i hope there is like one out there somewhere.

1. Here's a site that lists world cruises including prices.   

http://www.cruisecompete.com/specials/regions/world/1

Prices listed, however, are usually based on two people in a cabin, and you will likely face some high "single supplement" costs in addition.   (Two people in a cabin will spend more onboard, so cruise lines charge you more to sail alone.  You may be able to do better on the rates if you request competitive quotes via CruiseCompete).

2. Short of chartering your own ship and crew, I don't see any way you could customize your own itinerary.

Good luck!

Various world cruises from most of the major cruise lines, typically 100 days in duration.
Travelling on your own you would have to pay double as cabins are sold on the basis of double occupancy.
No possibility to customise ports of call.  Prearranged about 18 months in advance as the cruise lines sell segments all along the way i.e Transatlantic to London (England), England to Barcelona (Spain), Barcelona to Alexandria (Egypt), Egypt to India via Suez canal etc.

yes there are multiple  around the world cruises, mainly offered by the more upscale lines.   

HOWEVER: you will pay as if there are 2 people in the cabin, even if it is just you.  so any price you find, DOUBLE IT  figure, $40K at least.  

 and no you cannot customize an itinerary unless you book several different legs of  a cruise with stops in between on shore.. say book  a Panamal Canal crossing, then fly to Asia and pick it up again and sail to India then fly to Europe to sail the Med before  flying to England to hit the Transatlantic corssing.
