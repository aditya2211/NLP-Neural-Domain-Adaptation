Just today I bought a medium rat for my beloved Ball Python Salazar (name after Harry Potter). Last time I got a medium rat it was a girl and my snake handled her easily. But today, I got a boy and realized that he is HUGE! I really do love my snake cause she is actually an affectionate cold-blooded creature. So my true question comes to this, how can I knock the rat out? If I threw him against a wall and still conscious he will run away, do I hang him by the tail so the blood can flush into his skull? I really do need answers and advice, and NOT INSULTING ANSWERS!! LIKE SERIOUSLY!! >:( Best answer shall receive points :)

iw ould just stick him in the tank and let your snake have a nice hunt for once, snakes jaws detach for this sort of this thing, so why not give her a good hunt,  but if you do want him knock him id just throw him against the wall or something,, lol i dont know, i agree with you though throw him, haha

Ok so if youre snake will take pre-killed, you can "gas it". Just put the rat in a sealed tupperwear container with no airholes and wait until it passes out and dies and then feed it.  If it won't take pre-killed and you usually feed live then you could hold the rat by the tail and whack it against a hard surface, like a refrigerator or wall. I don't like that option though - I think it's pretty cruel and I'd not done properly you'll end up really hurting the rat but not stunning him enough to stop possible injury to your snake. 
I would do the tupperwear idea TBH - easiest and most humane. You could also just wait until the rat passes out for about 1 minute and them feed it - at this point, it could still have a bit of a heart beat and be slightly still alive. And also maybe try holding the rat in feeding prongs so your snake can get a good hold and grip on his prey. 
Good luck! 
Just my opinion here - no judgement - getting your snake on frozen/thawed will prove to be much easier for you and safer for your snake in the long run. My opinion - take it for what it's worthâ€¦ :-)
