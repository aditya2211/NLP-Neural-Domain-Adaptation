3 weeks old baby budgie alone at night?
</Subject>
<Content>
I have a 3 week old baby budgie and I noticed that his/her mother does not stay with him in the nest at night. I have to mention that i recently separated the father into another cage close to the 'nest cage' because he and the mother were fighting. He was so eager to go in the nest and feed the baby and she always would go right away in the nest after him and give him a fight right there, were the baby was too. I thought it was dangerous for the baby so I moved him. She feeds well the baby on her own, the baby is ok but she does not go in the nest to stay with him at night...
What is the problem? Is this a transitional period for the baby...that he/she is left alone much more time?
I have to say that the baby does not scream after her of anything...he/she sleeps.

Budgies are breast feeding birds and it may be the male is bisexual. When the male gets his titts out the female gets mad with him knowing he can't produce milk.

It's fine - just make sure that the room the cage is in is kept warm. If the baby is feathered yet - which I'm sure he is mostly - he should be fine. Just remember to make sure the mother is properly caring for the baby. Ignore the answer above me, btw! ^_^
