When the French returned to Indochina at the end of WW II the Viet Minh were in control of the Red River Delta. They chased the Communists out of the capital (Hanoi) and retook control. Is that what you are referring to? You need to check out the French Indochina War (1946-1954) not the Vietnam War (1957-1975).
