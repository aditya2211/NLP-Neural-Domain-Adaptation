Used as a help for horses that are quite strong pullers while hacking, hunting and doing cross country.  It is a curb bit with a ported mouth piece and some horses appreciate this to give them more room in their mouths for their tongues.  It is not as precise as a pelham bit because it only uses one rein, though the modern ones have two or three slots on which to put the reins.  The lower the reins, the stronger the action and the lower the reins the stronger the action on the poll too.

Useful for younger kids who do not have big enough hands or the ability to handle two reins independently.

It just gives you a little leverage and curb pressure. It's nice for horses that need a little more than a snaffle. I know that's vague, but it depends on the horse. The rider needs to have independent hands as well, because you do NOT want to pull too hard on a bit like that. ;)
