What cleaners can I use to dust around my budgie. Would pledge be ok? If not, what is?

Your best bet would just be a swiffer duster -- they don't require cleaner. If you must use a cleaner, pledge should be fine if the area that you keep your parakeet in is well ventilated. I have had parakeets for a VERY long time, and I use pledge. Just keep a window open for a while for fresh air to circulate.

I agree w the answer from Nothing.  Even a cotton cloth (I like diapers) that is barely damp w water will work fine.  Swiffer or any type of micro-fiber cloth is excellent.  I use Miracle Cloth, they're fantastic, just don't use fabric softener or dryer sheets when cleaning them, it ruins their "grabbing" ability.   http://www.solutions.com/jump.jsp?itemID=1361&itemType=PRODUCT&path=1%2C3%2C477&iProductID=1361  If anything you use has a strong or lingering fragrance it can bother or potentially injure the bird.
