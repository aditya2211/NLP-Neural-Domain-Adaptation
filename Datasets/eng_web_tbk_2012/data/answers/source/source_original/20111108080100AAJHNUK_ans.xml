What are really good programs for smooth crisp Black & White editing? I use GIMP and Its not cutting it, looks terrible. Here's one of my shots in B&W

You could also try this in gimp. It will give you a lot more power, as well as control over how your black and white photo looks:

Open your image while it's still in color

Create a new layer and fill the later with black. Set the layer mode to "color" this will make your image blak and white. 

Click colors>>>levels and adjust each channel's color values. This will adjust the brightness and darkness of specific parts of an image.

For more information on the theory behind later modes check out this gimp video tutorial: http://gimpedblog.blogspot.com/2011/09/gimp-video-tutorial-how-to-convert.html 

For more information on adjusting exposure in gimp chef out this gimp video tutorial: http://gimpedblog.blogspot.com/2011/09/how-to-use-gimp-for-beginners-lesson-4.html 

Hope this helps.

depends what you want from "B&W"... many programs will use a generic B&W...

try something like photoscape which has different options...
