My cat had a seizure yesterday and was ill. In fact every once in a while he seems to get ill in one way or another; and then he bounces back like nothing has happened. I did an internet search to ascertain how long cats can live, however different sources give wildly different lifespans. My cat is 18 years old. In your experience how long do cats do cats typically live? Is he on his last legs or is it conceivable that he could be around for another 15 years as is claimed by some of the sources ive been looking at?

At 18 years, your cat has had a long life.  Indoor cats that are well cared for typically live 11-15 years.  Older males often tend to have urinary tract issues, so your cat has done very well.  Male cats very seldom live past 14-15 years.  Stories of cats living more than 25 years are rare.  Ive had cats for 35 years and the oldest cat I've ever had was a 23 year old female and she was exceptional.  By comparison, outdoor cats have a life expectancy of 3-7 years depending on how many predators are in the local environment.

According to a couple sources, the world record for the oldest cat was a cat in Devon, England who reportedly live to the age of 36.

I knew a cat that died in its sleep aged 21.   Anything after 12 is a bonus.
