Alright, so my dad had been wanting me to check my e mail for a few days but I never got around to it. (I just thought he wanted me to see one of those chain letter things again) so I fineally checked it, and it was an e mail from southwest airlines telling me the flight dates for out family trip to Florida!!! I got so excited!!!! It said it was in January but still!!!! So I kept reading and then I saw the dates, it was from mid day Friday and arriving home mid day monday. :( then I think I just kind of stopped smiling and just kind of sat there looking at the dates. (we live in Pennsylvania btw) I'm mad and upset now! Don't get me wrong I want to go, but for 2 days -_- I mean seriously. We are taking a 3 hour flight down to a fancy island in Florida and staying only 2 days. ****sigh**** not trying to sound snooty or stuck up but I mean really! Can someone please make me feel better about this trip!!!!

Well, I mean, you don't have to be mad about it. At least you get to go to Florida in JANUARY. And, having only two days makes you realize what you have with your family. "Nothing Gold Can Stay", honey. Enjoy it while you can, and then if your family enjoys it you can go again for a longer period of time. If they don't like it, it'll only be two days, remember? Hope you have a crapload of fun! (In a good way...)
