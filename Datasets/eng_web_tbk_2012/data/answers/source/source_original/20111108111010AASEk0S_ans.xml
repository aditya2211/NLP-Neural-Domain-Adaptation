is under tank heating or side tank heating better for a corn snake?

i was reading the package for a tank heater i bought for my 40 gallon tank for my snake and it said it can be put under the tank or on the side. im not worried about damaging the surface my tank is on because i can prop it up off the surface anyway. 
from my understanding, if its heated from the bottom, my snake risks burning its belly if it burrows and rests directly on top of the glass over the heater unless i buy some of that reptile carpet to put under the substrate, but it has better heat distribution 
if its from the side i dont have to worry about propping it up, but the snake can still burn itself if it slithers along the side of the tank and i also read that it doesnt distribute heat as well?  

what are your suggestions and opinons?

i use UTH's on all of my burrowing snakes. they will move if they get too warm-it's not like a heat rock which you should avoid at all costs. i usually put my own natural rock over the UTH and they are perfectly fine. i have over 40 corns, kings, and milks and have never had a problem with the UTH system. on the side is a waste-leave it on the bottom. good luck!

Bottom if you are worried about the snake burning itself put something overt it like newspaper... I now use a 75watt basking or heat bulb for mine and he seems to like it
