On the RER/Metro:

In the airport, follow the signs that say "Paris by train". Buy a ticket for Paris. This will get you on the RER B line going into town. Stay on it until the "Saint-Michel Notre-Dame" station. Change there to the Metro 4 line going toward "Porte d'Orleans". Get off at the "Montparnasse Bienvenue" station.

On the Air France bus:

As I recall, this bus drops you off near the Opera in Paris. You'll still have to take another bus or the Metro down to Montparnasse.

On the bus: Get on Bus 95 going toward "Porte de Vanves". Buy a ticket from the driver. Stay on the bus until the "Montparnasse Bienvenue" stop.

On the Metro: Get in the Metro at Opera. Take the 8 line toward "Balard" until the "Invalides" station. Change there to the 13 line toward "Chatillon Montrouge" and take it until the "Montparnasse Bienvenue" station.
