10 gallon nano reef ideas?
</Subject>
<Content>
I have a 10 gallon nano reef with 10 lbs of live fiji rock,  and 10 lbs of live carribean sand.  I am aware of the maintenance involved in keeping a tank this size.  I am currently maintaining a gravity level of 1.024.  I have a 10 gallon filter on it.  I also have a powerhead, getting another soon.  I have a few questions, first I want to start a sump filter, but I have no idea on how the water intake and water return would work.  How would I need to set a sump for this 10 gallon?  Do I need a protein skimmer or any other equipment?  thanks

Unless the tank has a built in overflow box (which I'm certain it doesn't) then you have to get one of those hang on back overflow boxes so that you can install a sump. The piping would lead down into your sump from the overflow box. On the other end of the sump, you would have a small return pump with a hose that puts the water back into your tank.

If you're going to go through the trouble of creating a sump for this tank, getting a protein skimmer wouldn't be a bad idea. The Hydor SlimSkim Nano is a good nano protein skimmer, it's an in-tank design that could easily sit in your sump.
