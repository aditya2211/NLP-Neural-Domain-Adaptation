Off season is good, however, the Disney cruises are almost ALWAYS completely booked. I would suggest a warmer season, but not Spring Break or early summer. You may also want to avoid Thanksgiving week and the Christmas holidays.

We REALLY enjoyed our balcony-- coffee in the mornings, drinks at night, standing outside when docking and leaving port-- however, it is quite a bit more expensive. With young ones, I would definitely get a window or view room so they can see outside.

Check out the kids' space as soon as you get onboard. Do NOT feel guilty about taking them there. They have a BLAST so the sooner they get there, the sooner they can have fun.

We liked getting the late dinner seating, so you have more time to see movies and stuff but if your kids are 'early to bed' you may want the earlier seating for dinners.

Bring some sort of magnet or small magnetic whiteboard for your door. All of the doors tend to look alike and having 'something' on your door helps you and your kids find your room easier. You can also leave notes for the rest of your family (husband) about where you are at any given point. Cell phones do NOT work on board but they give you a 'walkie-talkie' kind of phone in your room that WILL work onboard.

Each evening you will get a 'magazine' called The Navigator which lists all of the activities for the next day. We always took ours to dinner and discussed what things we felt we 'had' to do and which ones we felt like skipping in lieu of just chilling.

Any time would be great. off season cruises might actually be better with preschoolers as prices might be lower in the off season.

My wife and I, in our 60's at the time, originally planned a 3 generation trip but some family emergencies caused everyone else to cancel. We had a ball.

We had an inside cabin and it is what I would recommend. There are so many things to do that you will only use your room for sleeping and the extra cost of the balcony is wasted.

The children can be checked in and checked out in a safe way at many activities so you can have a bit of free time without the little ones. The range of activities can be illustrated by describing the water activities. There is a splash fountain (no standing water) for little ones still in diapers; Next is a wading pool for those who are potty trained; Then a family pool; Finally there is a pool for adults only with kids not allowed.

You will never be so spoiled in your life as you are on a Disney Cruise. If you stay with your dining schedule, every night is dinner and a show. The real payoff is that you will have the same waiter for the entire cruise. Our waiter quickly grasped the fact that I like Ginger ale and rather spicy foods while my wife's taste ran to lemonade and less spicy fare. Since they knew our preferences, we almost always went along with their menu suggestions and were never sorry we did. Obviously they had a full beverage list including alcohol for adults who wanted it.

If you should miss a meal, you also missed a great show. but food is always available and it is consistently good. I think I gained three pounds in my week long cruise.
