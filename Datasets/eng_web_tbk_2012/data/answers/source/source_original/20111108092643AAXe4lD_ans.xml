Hi there,
Please choose the parakeet...Heres my reason..... I did the same thing that you did for christmas. I ended up getting a pair of zebra finches for christmas. At first it was all cool and all. They were chirping and doing their every day business. After a couple of weeks I got tired of them. They are quite messy and you cannot hold or pet them. Ive tried to tame them and they just would not get tamed. They dont want to be held or touched. I want a bird that I can hold and do tricks. I still have them and they are doing well.

A couple of months after I got parakeets/budgies. They are adorable they have beautiful colors and personality. I love them. First of all they are very tame. I tamed them in 4 days. They can do tricks and they arent messy. The whole family loves them. My parents even plays with them. They are a big part of our family. I hope this helps you with your decision.   

They are both about the same noise level. 
When choosing a parakeet look for a young one. (the younger the eaiser to tame) Look for clean smooth feathers, beak, and clean vent feathers (the feathers around the butt..dirty vent feathers means the bird is not healthy) Look for a dark eye with no circles (the older ones have a circle ring in their eyes). Look for a lot of stripes in their head that starts from the beak and goes back to the back fo the bird. the stripes are like hair the less stipes the older. (think of a balding man lol) Look for clean feathers. If you want a boy the cere (the nostrils piece above the beak) must be blue. The girl has either pink or brown. I would recommend that you get two parakeets. But get either one male and one female, or two males. Do not get two females. They sometimes dont get along (you know how some girls are lol hahahaahh but for real though, two girls tend to fight a lot. I have one yellow girl and a green and yellow boy. They are the best!

If you choose to get a parakeet this is a trick that I used to tame them.  However if you plan on getting one, then get more than one at the same time they need company. My mom told me how to tame them and I was very happy with the results. It took me 4 days to get the new one to be able to step on and eat out of my hand. These are the steps I used. Honestly they have worked for me twice with my parakeets. Hopefully they will work for you.
1) When you get the bird, place him or her or them in the cage. Leave them in there with food and water and such for about 2 hours.

2) Then place you hand in the cage. I took the cage and place it next to the couch. Then I sat on the couch, placed one hand in the cage, holding a millet spray. (this way the will associate your hand with food, and birds love food lol) Then I turned on the tv and watch. This way they will see that your hand is good and its not going to grab them or hurt them. Do this for about one hour. (you can take breaks if you have too) and repeat the steps after about 2 hours.

3) After about day 2, they will start to eating the millet spray from your hand. (do not take away the food dish from the birds, they will associate you as the person who takes away their food)....Then take your finger and place it under their belly, in front of their feet and say up. Push you finger to their feet gently and say up. ( the first couple of times they will fly all over the cage but as long as you dont jump back or screem they will get used to you) They will have no choice but to go on your finger. When they see that you arnt harming them, the will go up on your finger when you say up.

4) If they are not going up by now you just gotta keep trying and keep trying. Do not hit, yell, or harm them. You have patience. Dont give up! After a couple of weeks mines knows when I say shoulder it means ot go on my sholder, when I say up it means to jump up on my finger, when I say up and out it means up on my finger and out of the cage. and when I say go home it means to go in the cage. 

Good luck! They worked for me and I hope they worked for you! They are awesome!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! 
And thats my reason why you should choose a parakeet over a finch.
