I have a kitten who just turned 3 months today. He's a good kitty, just when he plays he bites REALLY hard. Almost every day he'd even wake me up like 5am in the morning, trying to bite my arm. And when I move it I guess he figures I'm playing. x.x 

I read somewhere that you have to hold his mouth together, and keep it that way til he panics. That seems cruel to me though. Any other way?? Do you think he's teething? It's getting out of hand.
Yeah, I thought that the holding his mouth thing sounded wrong. No worries, i didn't try. 

He does have toys, a scratching post, LOTS of mice, balls, yarn, a feathery birdy toy, etc. He'd just randomly walk up to you and start the biting. When i put him off of my bed, he jumps back on and same thing.

yes do not hold any animals mouth shut it wil close their air way, hes just a kitty and they are very rambunctious , get him toys. lots of them, feather ones work best, also when he bites you in the morning put him down off your bed, to show him that you will not tolerate that, he will get it, hes also probably teething, so toys are your best bet
