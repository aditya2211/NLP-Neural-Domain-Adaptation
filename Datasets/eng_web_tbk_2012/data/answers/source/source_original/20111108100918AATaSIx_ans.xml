How do I take care of my newborn baby fish?

I am nervous that my other fish will eat them, and I don't know what to feed them! I have counted around 25 of them and they currently reside in a 20  gallon tank.

You could move all the babies into a fry net breeder or move all of the bigger fish (also the parents) to a different tank to avoid the babies getting eaten. Feed the babies 3-4 times a day with flakes.

Provide plenty of hiding places like rocks, plants, etc in the tank.  Its natural for some babies to be eaten by adults and if all of them survived your tank would be very overcrowded.  Look in the pet stores for "fry food" or "baby fish foods".
