New Zealand skilled migrant visa?
</Subject>
<Content>
If you apply for a skilled migrant workers visa and it is accepted do you have to find work in the same sector as your skills on your application or can you take up other work if you can't find something in your own field. I have posted this question on the NZ visa site and can't get any info, does anyone know.???

It depends on the conditions of your skilled migrant visa. Your visa should say whether or not you are restricted to work in a specific sector. If your visa does not restrict you from taking any work in New Zealand then you can work in any sector. 

It only matters if you received an offer of employment or if you are currently working in New Zealand and used that job in your application to get your skilled migrant visa.
