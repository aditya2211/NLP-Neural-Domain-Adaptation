Are you sure it isn't dirt on the sensor?
Put the camera on manual focus and set focus to infinity
Take a photo of a very light plain subject close to the lens using long exposure and smallest aperture you have - over expose by a couple of stops
You will see in the image if there is dirt as that will be the only thing in focus

Cure is to get the sensor cleaned

There should be a Pixel Mapping function in the menu that will get rid of them, most sensors have a few dead and flipped pixels, some only show up on long exposures.
