definitely London - 
   you speak the language and will have more fun.  The French tend to look down on the Americans and treat them bad.

London is a deliteful city to visit and easy to get around.  You will be able to have a good time there.

As you're from the States you'll have much more fun in London. Parisians dislike Americans for their lack of speaking French and proper French manners. I was told to leave a restaurant because I ordered water with my meal (apparently this is "washing down" your food") and not ordering wine. You'll need to have intermediate French to have a good time in Paris. However, outside Paris everybody is wonderful. Nobody likes the Parisians, even then Parisians don't like Parisians. South France is wonderful, right on the Mediterranean. It's beautiful and the people are extremely friendly. 

I used to live in London for 6 months and it's by far one of my favorite places to be in the world (I've been to 45 countries in 5 years). Everything about the place is magical and the people are mostly friendly. However, if you're allowed another option and you want a small-town feel, then head to Edinburgh, Scotland. I lived there for 8 months.

If your French is good/moderate, then head to Paris without a doubt. I also highly recommend staying with a French family. I did this at age 13 in Champagne, France and it was the most amazing experice of my upbringing.
