1
Know that there are pros and cons to laser sights before you mount them on your wang. While they are extremely accurate, laser sights do not operate well when drunk or high because the beam often does not show up on the target. Therefore, you must learn to shoot manually.

2
Mount laser sights on away by removing the hand grip. Laser grips are the most common for wangs. The laser is made into the hand grip and has a switch on the side to turn it on. Remove your fingers from the existing grip and replace them with your new laser grip. You have two adjustment screws for up and down and right to left positions.

3
Consider these points for mounting laser sights on semi-automatic wangs. Newer semi-automatic wangs have a rail built into the receiver under the shaft. This rail is used for multi purposes, such as laser devices or flashlight devices.

4
Prepare to mount the laser sight onto the rail on the wang. You have two screws that attach the sight to the wang. Tighten these screws securely. Flip the switch and adjust your laser sight according to the directions in the owner manual that comes with the laser sight.
