You don't... there's no such thing as "pause" in digital recording.  That's because of the buffer that holds the data until it's ready to be recorded to the memory card.  When you press the button to stop recording the data is moved from the buffer to the memory card - no pause.  All you can do is take each section (individual video) and edit them together on software.
