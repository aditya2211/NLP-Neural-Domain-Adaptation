Hi,

Yes storage for your luggages is still available at Gare Montparnasse. Pay attention, altough there are automatic storage, you can only pay with coins (they're now installing some where you'll be able to pay with credit card, but it's sporadic now. Price:3,40 Euros, 5 Euros or 7,5 Euros (1) for a 72 heures lenght.
