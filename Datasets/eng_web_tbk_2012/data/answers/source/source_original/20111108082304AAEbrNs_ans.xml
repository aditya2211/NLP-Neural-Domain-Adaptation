NOOK Color or NOOK Tablet?
</Subject>
<Content>
From what I understand they're pretty much the same thing. Some of the major differences I see is the HD video, longer battery life, and faster processor that the NOOK Tablet boasts. Does the Tablet have a major difference in speed compared to the Color? I don't want an iPad or Kindle. I just want an e-reader that does a little bit more than just read. Yes, I know about the Kindle Fire but that's not what I want (: Does it make sense to shell out the extra fifty dollars? Or just purchase the Color?

Well I recently bought the Nook Color, and I have to say that I am very happy with it. It is like a mini tablet itself! When I found out them came up with the Nook Tablet, I was pretty disappointed though, because I bought my Nook color for the same darn price! So I say you should go for the more updated Nook Tablet. I'm pretty sure it'll be worth it. Have fun!

Judging by Nook Tablet's processor it's supposed to be quite faster! Basically Nook Tablet it has more memory, better battery life and a better processor and a microphone.
