Hey,

Be happy you get a bit, many of us never got nothing :)

There's a Canon EOS T2i, with the exact same sensor, just no articulating screen. It's around $100 less, which means you get the same camera but quicker!

Don't worry about it. If you can't even do basic math, you'll never figure out how to use a DSLR camera properly.
