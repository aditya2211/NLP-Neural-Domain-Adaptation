Depends of what.  Ounces measure weight, pints measure volume.

If you mean fluid ounces, 20, as opposed to the 16 in America. An Irish pint is larger than a US one.

20 fluid ounces in a Pint in Ireland

as R-G said, there are only 16 in an American one.

Know this well because I remember an 'irish' pub in the town in canada i grew up in used to advertise the cheapest pints of guinness in town, but they served them in american sized pints.

That place didn't stay open too long :D
