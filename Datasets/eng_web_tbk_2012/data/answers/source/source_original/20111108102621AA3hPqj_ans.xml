bearded dragon spikes?

<Content>
bit of a stupid question but do the spikes/spines (whatever you call them) on their side and face area ever go hard. or are they just supposed to look like they are so nothing will try to eat them

becca is right .

iv owned beardies for ovr 3 yrs and i handle mine all the time.. they dont go hard lik eneedle hard but they arnt pillow soft. they use them to look prickly.. would you try to eat a cactus [if u had no knife] i know i wouldnt. they puff out to look bigger and badder and they can scratch you a lil if ur holding them to tight  :)

Theyre not really hard. Beardies are actually quite delicate. I'm assuming it's to scare off predators / like how they will puff up their neck spikes to make them look bigger to predators or enemies.

they dont hurt unless your stupid enough to press on them. They just are there as an adaptation.
