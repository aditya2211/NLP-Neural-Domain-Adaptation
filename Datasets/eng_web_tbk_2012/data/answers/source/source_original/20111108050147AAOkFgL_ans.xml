Well,I'm about to graduate in less then a year,and I'm planning to study medical school.But since in my country it lasts for minimum 6 years,and I want to go aground the world,what do you think,should I do it before or after medical school?

If you can afford to go before, then by all means, GO.  If you have to wait, due to financial reasons, then wait.  I would much rather put it off until I can afford to have the vacation of a lifetime as I'm sure this trip is intended to be.  Airfare alone will be incredibly expensive so make sure you have the money and of course free time to take your time and have a great time.
