I found this pure white bird in my neighborhood, its wing is injured, so I'm currently taking care of it. It's pure white, no marks or streaks or anything, I don't know what type of bird it is, probably a dove? What should I feed it? Is normal bird food fine? (Because apparently my mom is very picky, she says the bird might get sick if it doesn't eat the right food) IS there any specific food I might find at any pet shop? (petco, petsmart) ..... thanks!

Doves are a species of pigeon ,they are Seed eaters, they do not eat bread,or worms. make sure that you have a shallow dish of water for it. as they can drink a lot.

If you have a pet store near buy some wheat,pigeon corn or even mixed bird seed will do,but do not feed bread.
