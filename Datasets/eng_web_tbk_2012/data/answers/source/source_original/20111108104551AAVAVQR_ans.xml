He's the issue, you are trying to "Make" them mate. This is like trying to Make 2 people get married. It doesn't work.

First you need a compatible pair. Sounds like your 2 at least tolerate each other, so there is hope there.

Then the need to be mature, that is, old enough, and big enough to breed. This may be around 1/2 of their full adult size, probably 4-5" for those guys.

Then the environment. Large tank, no annoying tankmates, perfect water conditons and really good feeding. The difference is what they need to live, VS what's ideal for them.  Get that right, and they will mate when THEY are ready. You can't MAKE them mate, you can only encourage them.

Jack Dempseys are not an easy cichlid to breed. Most of the time one is more interested in breeding than the other. Bredders take the one that in not very interested and put it alone in a breeeding tank for 3-5 days. The tank should have a hide space big enough for one fish, or a few of them, but at least 1 cave big enough for two fish to fit in. The p H should be 6.5-7.

Now feed the one in the breeding tank as much bloodworms, blackworms and/or earthworms as it can eat for 3-5 days. Then add the other mate. They may not respond right away and they may fight so ther smaller one can fit in one of hide spaces if it gets attacked.

When the males aggressive behavior stops, it is ready to spawn. The two lay their eggs inside the cave you made for them.
