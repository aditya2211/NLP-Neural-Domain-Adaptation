Most likely not, if there is not a bird sitting on the eggs.

This is hard to tell. Cockatiels can lay unfertilized eggs as well. Just because you have a male and female, it cannot be guaranteed the two mated.

You can try picking up the eggs and holding it up against a very bright light. If you see a dark spot in the egg, that means it is fertilized and will hatch if cared for properly.

Have fun.
