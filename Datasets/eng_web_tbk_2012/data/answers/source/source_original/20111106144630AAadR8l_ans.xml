I was playing a video game that has a m16 Vietnam model, and in the game it's 3-shot burst. My brother said they only had full-auto and semiautomatic during Vietnam.
My questions are..
1) what thes difference between a modern m16 and Vietnam m16?
2) did Vietnam m16's have a 3-shot burst function?

To save money Robert McNamara ordered that the ammunition for the new M-16s being sent to SEA in the early 60s use an older (dirtier) type of gunpowder meant for use with the M-14. He also ordered that the receiver not get a (I think chrome) coating that helped keep the gun from jamming. Than the troops being issued the weapon were told it was self-cleaning, which it wasn't. As a result there was a problem with the weapon jamming. Once the troops started cleaning the weapon properly (even with the dirtier powder) the Vietnam era M-16 turned out to be a good weapon for the purpose it was being used for. 

The screw-up was the kind of things you have happen when you have bean-counters (and McNamara was nothing if not a bean-counter) instead of soldiers in charge of the military.

Today's weapons do not have that kind of problem, and are much more reliable.
