<Content>
I am 17 years old. I do not get along with my family. I dislike this urban society and want to leave this whole enviroment. I am very unhappy here. I don't know the best way of doing it. Would it be best for me to finish college? wait for 18th birthday? 

I live in London. I want to go travelling. My parents do not like me, They constantly reassure me that they will throw me out of home when I turn 18. I don't particularly want to stay with them atm either. But right now its the most convenient thing to do.

Anyway Advice for travelling. What is the best way of doing it? Hotels for travelling will be expensive. anybody is open to answers but I would much prefere somebody with traveling experience. 

I want to go all over :) I don't have a set route yet.

Get a back pack and sleeping bag or good warm blanket.
Wool is best. Light ,warm, but also itchy.
Hit the road. You can always beg for spare change when you get hungry.

Should get some survival skills before setting out on your own.
