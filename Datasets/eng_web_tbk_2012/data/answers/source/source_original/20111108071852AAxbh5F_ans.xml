Did anything happen before losing his trust? Birds are hard to gain trust with, but it's lost so easily! A simple hand gesture could have resorted to him being afraid of you. Eating by his cage and keeping a "sleep cage" in your room is a good idea. Birds eat and sleep with their flock, not predators. Keep his cage open and go on your computer, or read a book, etc and maybe he will come out to you. Let him go at his own pace, don't rush with him, and never ever resort to physical violence with your bird. This with ruin your bond, and you probably won't have another chance to build one. Patience is the key. =) he might never be a cuddly, loving, tame bird, but you can still have a friendly bond. But then again he could be!

dat bird is smart.
like my dogs, they really like me and trust me, but when I open the door to get them outside, they run from me, they know I'm going to take them outside and they don't like it.
the bird must know that when you open the cage door it means that you will put him in the cage, and birds don't usually like cages.
so, I don't think the bird don't trust you, but still don't like the cage.
