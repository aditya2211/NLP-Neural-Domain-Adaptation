Women's rain coat...where can I find one?
</Subject>
<Content>
I'm going on a trip to Europe soon, and I need to find a good, quality raincoat. I've looked and looked, but cannot find one anywhere! I would prefer a simple, fitted black one. It actually needs to be relatively waterproof - the last one I bought had me soaked in anything more than light/moderate rain. I'll pay up to 200-250 for it if I have to.
