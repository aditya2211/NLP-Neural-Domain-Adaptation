I'm not sure about the origin of the name but they are a lot of different cities with different and unique names like Miramar so it's just a name.

There's lots of towns called Miramar, it'd help alot if you listed a state or some sort of context you're looking for it in.  Here's two examples:
 
There's a Miramar in Florida, just north of Miami.
 
There's also a Miramar in California, the site of a rather large Air Force Base...Miramar California is a bit north of San Diego.
