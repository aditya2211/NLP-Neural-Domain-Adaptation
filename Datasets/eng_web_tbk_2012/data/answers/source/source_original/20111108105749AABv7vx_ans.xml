Me and my family are moving into a new house just outside a small town. We are currently living a mile from the town in a house surrounded by fields but the new house is beside a busy road. We have had the cat for 10 years and dont want to leave it. How could we make it settle in a new house.

you are not just moving house - your cat is losing his territory. territory is very important to cats, and they are very nervous when they go into a new place - a new house could be full of predators, or unknown menaces - well at least he thinks so.
you will need to give him only a small place to explore, so he can make it his territory, and feel safe there. then, he can have a place to retreat to when he feels scared.

you will need to get his box and bowls, and whatever blanket and toys are his, and smell like home, and put him in a room. the room you sleep in is best (seeing you so relaxed that you are sleeping will send the message that everything is OK), but others will work just as well.
close the door, and keep him in there for a week. he will feel much safer in that one room, than in a huge unknown house. he will explore the room, mark everything with his cheek, and try to make it feel like his territory. he will reassure himself that no other animal is in there, and that no other animal will come in - he is afraid that he is in someone else's territory when he is in a new house. in a week's time, he will have made it his, and will be getting more bored than afraid. 

let him out for half an hour, to explore. then put him back in. he will be freaked out, so going back to his territory will make him much happier. 
extend the time he is out each day, but for the first month, always put him in his room at night, so he feels safe to sleep.

soon he will make the whole house his, but he needs that one safe place to start from.

remember to visit with him while he is in the room, and tell him how good he is.
remember to give him the time he needs to feel that the room is his - rush it, and he will be afraid of the whole house for a long time. he might even start peeing on things in fear.

good luck with your new house and with his new territory!
