where can I find the best tours to the Mekong Delta at reasonable prices?

<Content>
will only be in Ho chi Minh for 4 days and I am looking for a 1 day or 2 day trip to Mekong delta. I have been researching on line and find things are quite pricey but the tours look great. 
Should I just settle and book on line? or is it better if I wait till I get there?
If I wait, would the tours I find there for less money be the same quality type tours?
Also, any tour recommendations would be very helpful a well. 
Thank you!

If you want reliable and inexpensive... try Sinh Cafe/Tourist.  The are located right at 248 De Than St. in the heart of the back packer district.  I have taken this tour and it was great.  I did an overnight in a home stay that was sweet and the water market was wonderful.  I don't remember the exact cost but remember thinking how inexpensive it was.
Also, Sinh Cafe has been around for a long time and is very reputable.  And no, I do not work for them.  :) I am just a satisfied customer.  
And don't expect to party on this tour.  The south is not like the regular tourist towns.  Very few clubs and night activities.  
Oh, if you are confused.  Sinh Cafe is not a Cafe.  It is a tour agency and they have their own buses etc.

There isn't much to see in the delta, it's a lifestyle not a resort area. If you're adventurous you can take a bus or water taxi to My Tho (near where we live) or Can Tho. From either of those cities, you can venture out and spend a day in the country.
Most of the tourists that I've come across buy tours along the My Tho waterfront. You take a boat across the river, then spend a day biking, eating at a local restaurant, buying souvenirs and doing other things that are geared towards tourists. 
The countryside is very beautiful, especially if you have a few months (or years) to get to know the place.

PS, If you make it to Thanh Pho Ben Tre, stay a night at my friend Ken's hotel. It's called Kiwi Heaven and it's across the river from Cho Ben Tre. It's a little hard to get to by foot, they're rebuilding the bridge, but you can get someone to moto-taxi you there for a dollar or less. He's an ex-pat from New Zealand and he's been in town for awhile. He'll set up a real tour of the area for you, not some tourist fantasy. 
Have a good trip where-ever you end up.

We went with Intrepid as a part of their North to South Vietnam Trip, but they do offer this one day separately. We had a great time and visited a location where they made coconut candies, visited a local restaurant which was attached to a fish farm, rode in modified quad bikes and had some tropical food at what appeared to be a local hangout. Intrepid is good at getting you away from the most touristy spots and showing you something a little different.
