My canon t2i stops working at times as in the power bottom is switched to "on" but the camera does not respond to any function.  the camera only begins to work again when i take out the battery and put it back in.  
did anyone have this issue?  is it worthy to send in for warranty repair?
thanks!

Sounds simple enough to me . Your camera isn't acting normally, you got warranty, let Canon deal with it.

I would agree.  I shoot a t1i and haven't had such an issue.  I also agree it's under warranty so get in touch with Canon.  It sounds like a firmware issue and the camera requires a re-boot just like what happens in a computer - needs a re-start from time to time but it shouldn't be happening in a camera.
Call Canon
