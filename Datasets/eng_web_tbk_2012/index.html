<h1>English Web Treebank</h1>
<h3 class="subtitle">LDC2012T13</h3>

<h3>Introduction</h3>

<p> English Web Treebank, LDC2012T13 and ISBN 1-58563-621-5, was developed by 
  the Linguistic Data Consortium (LDC) with funding through a gift from Google 
  Inc. It consists of over 250,000 words of English weblogs, newsgroups, email, 
  reviews and question-answers manually annotated for syntactic structure and 
  is designed to allow language technology researchers to develop and evaluate 
  the robustness of parsing methods in those web domains. </p>
 

<h3>Data</h3>

<p> This release contains 254,830 word-level tokens and 16,624 sentence-level 
  tokens of webtext in 1174 files annotated for sentence- and word-level tokenization, 
  part-of-speech, and syntactic structure. The data is roughly evenly divided 
  across five genres: weblogs, newsgroups, email, reviews, and question-answers. 
  The files were manually annotated following the  <a href="./docs/WebtextTBAnnotationGuidelines.pdf">
sentence-level tokenization  guidelines for web text</a> included in this release and the word-level 
tokenization guidelines developed for English treebanks in the 
<a href="http://projects.ldc.upenn.edu/gale/index.html">DARPA 
  GALE</a> project. Only text from the subject line and message body of posts, 
  articles, messages and question-answers were collected and annotated.</p>
<p><u>Weblogs</u> are interactive web sites that display content as discrete entries 
  or posts and allow viewers to comment on entries and engage in discussions. 
  They are typically managed by individuals and use informal or colloquial language. 
  The weblog data in this release was collected by LDC and covers the period 2003-2006.</p>
<p><u>Newsgroups</u> are repositories of online discussions pertaining to a topic 
  or interest area. They consist of &quot;threads&quot; that in turn contain articles 
  with comments and discussion from group users. The newsgroup data in this release 
  was collected by LDC and covers the period 2003-2006. </p>
<p><u>Email</u> are messages sent to discrete individuals or well defined groups 
  via the TCP-IP Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP). The email messages in this 
  corpus are a subset of emails sent by Enron Corporation employees during the 
  period 1999-2002. Specifically, those messages are contained in the <a href="http://verbs.colorado.edu/enronsent/">Enronsent 
  Corpus</a>, a collection of 96,107 email messages from the sent folders of Enron 
  email users which were processed to remove any content not generated by human 
  users. </p>
<p>The <u>reviews</u> in this corpus were gleaned from online reviews of businesses 
  and services on various Google web sites written by individuals. This information 
  was provided to LDC by Google in 2011; the dates of individual reviews are not 
  available.</p>
<p><u>Question-answers</u> are posts from Yahoo!'s community-driven question-answering 
  web site, <a href ="http://answers.yahoo.com/">Yahoo! Answers</a>, where individuals 
  submit and answer questions which may be on any topic. This data was collected 
  in 2011; the dates of individual question-answers were not collected.</p>
